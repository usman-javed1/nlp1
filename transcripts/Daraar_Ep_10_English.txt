Since I have come 
I am observing you are in the mood to bite. What has happened? You live in this home, 
you take care of the things here. If he doesn’t ask you, who will he ask? Now go. Go find his file. Come on, go. I don’t interfere in any of his matters. I told you, go find his file. He must need it. And show this useless tantrums later. 
Since you have been living here you have lost your mind. You came here to serve here, not to rule that 
you are throwing so many taunts at me. Okay. Okay, go. 
No need to speak so much nonsense. Thank God you came. I was afraid that in your anger you
 might tell something to aunt. Why did you call me here? I had hurt your heart, how could I not apologize? You realized this really soon. If I had not realized it, 
I would have been in the hospital right now. I was worried for you. Lies. Mama has told me everything. The hospital people didn’t let you stay there, or else you wouldn’t have left your daughter
 and wife to come to me. I am not worth that much. I lied to them. I made an excuse. Now pray that this excuse doesn’t get revealed, or else I have no excuse to justify what I said. 
Why? Why did you put yourself in so much trouble? 
Why did you leave your wife and daughter, and come? You cannot be so cruel. The ones who has wounded you is saying this. I am surprised. I also put an ointment on the wound. Listen, I am well aware of your pain. I know well the pain you are going through, and I am really sorry, 
I didn’t do anything on purpose. You have no idea what torture I am going through. I said I am sorry. I promise I will make amends for all sorrows. Just let me live with the world. It is necessary. her hold on this home has become stronger. No. Not at all. A woman’s hold is strong when she rules a man’s heart. 
And you own my heart, and not Irha. You can only talk. Okay listen, come. Sit with me. Come. Come. Sit. Sit comfortably. You took so long to find a file. I had found the file, mama. Really? Then where were you for so long? 
What were you doing? I was telling Shakur about the breakfast. 
We have to take breakfast to the hospital tomorrow and I have also made arrangements for your nihari. Okay, it is good that you told him. Okay, we will do one thing, 
we will go to the hospital early. Irha is not at home, and we are living in her home, I don’t like it. Are you not a little too worried about Irha, now. Idiot, if you were in her place, I would have said the same thing. This is what I am sad about mama. Why am I not in Irha’s place? What happened now? What are you thinking? Okay tell me, 
who does Irha’s daughter take up after? Shaheer or Irha? Right now she is in the emergency. You just pray that both of them come home safely. It will take them a day or two. Why? What happened? Hey, the child has been born premature. That is why Shaheer is so worried? Really? What do the doctors say? The doctors have given us a lot of hope, but we will find out 
the real thing when we go there tomorrow. You just pray to God that both of them are fine. I am really worried for Irha. For a mother, what can be a bigger sorrow than a child. May God have mercy. Good morning. Are you awake? Doctor, where is my daughter? She is in the nursery. But you cannot meet her right now, she is not well. My child. Where is my child, nurse? Is she fine? Take me to my daughter. I have to go to my daughter. There is nothing to worry about. Don’t stress out or you will get unwell. Shaheer. Where is my husband? Take me to my husband. Please. Please, nurse. Those people went back last night. Leaving me alone here? Yes, there were a lot of people, they said they would come back in the morning. Do you need something? Do you need something? He left without meeting me. Are so many distances created between husband and wife, 
when a child is born? When she doesn’t feel like it, 
why are you forcing her? You talk to your sister, she doesn’t listen to me at all. I am here to take care of her. you are getting late for your office, you get ready. You have made her dependent on you so badly. She argues with me on everything. I told you, you are getting late for office, and after all, when she is hungry, she will eat. Why can you not stay with me in this room? You know, I can only sleep in my room. Then take me to your room with you. After all, I am lying here alone. You are not lying here, you are taking care of our future happiness. And then you are not allowed to go up 
and down the stairs. You know that. I cannot take a risk. What happened? I don’t want to stay in this room alone anymore. I want to stay with you, 
I want to spend time with you. It feels like I have been imprisoned in these four walls. There is nothing like that. Just a little time. Where is my husband? Take me to my husband. Please. Please, nurse. Those people went back last night. Leaving me alone here? Yes, there were a lot of people, they said they would come back in the morning. Do you need something? Come. Good morning. Congratulations to you. Thank you so much Shaheer. Now get fine quickly, so that we can go home. You left me and my daughter alone here. I am sorry. Hospital rules. I was helpless, or else me and aunty wanted to stay here. What do you say, aunty? Yes, child, all night I couldn’t stay in your worry. 
As soon as it was morning, I told him to take me to my daughter. Tell me, are you feeling alright? What will happen to me? I am absolutely fine. But our daughter, Shaheer… the hospital people are not letting me meet her. I want to go with her. Please take me to her. But Irha how can you go in this condition? Sajjal is absolutely right. Hey, it is just wait till the evening, rest a little right now. 
You can go see her in the evening. Did you see our daughter? How is she? Me and Sajjal are going to see her right now. I will get her pictures for you on my way back. Aunty, shall we go? Yes. Yes. Child. Go ahead. I will give Irha breakfast and come. Come on, go. Don’t worry, I am here. After all I am her only aunt. Yes? God, thank you so much my Lord. Everything went fine. Just wait till the evening, then you can see your little angel. Hey, I will bring breakfast. What are you doing? It is a hospital, 
be a little careful. You don’t see the place in love You don’t defame your lover in love like this in public. Can I ask you something? If I get jealous of your love with your daughter,
 then? What will you do? She is really pretty. And she takes up after you. Who else will she take up after, 
apart from her handsome father. When will I be able to see my daughter, 
Shaheer. I cannot wait anymore. What are the doctors saying? She is absolutely alright. Just wait for two to three days, after that no one can separate her from you. What name did you think of? Fatima. Fatima? This is a really pretty name. Excuse me. Yes, Mr. Ashfaq? Really? Wow. That’s great news. Congratulations. All this is possible because of your hard work. I will see you in the office. Again, great news. Great news. Good job.
 Thank you. What is the matter? You are really happy. This is great. My daughter is really lucky for me. There was a deal, we were after for a long time. 
Just got it. Thank you Irha. Thank you so much for everything. Thank you, Shaheer. Hmmm… Shaheer, please ask the driver to drop me
and mama dropped home. Why do you need the driver? 
I will drop you myself. Please stay. I am alone here anyway, Sajjal. Irha I feel feverish, I have a headache too. I want to go home and rest for a while. After all, brother Shakur is unable to take care of the home,
 till I don’t stay on his head. I will do one thing, I will leave mama with you. 
What do you say, Shaheer? Yes, that is right. I will ask aunty…
No, Shaheer. She will worry for no reason, please, there is no reason to leave her here. I will be back in an hour. Don’t worry. Okay? You please stay here. Irha, I will come and go in a flash. Come on. Oh wow, Shaheer you did all this? This is nothing to welcome my daughter. You will see what I do in future. Such big surprises as soon as your daughter came. See, how pretty she looks while sleeping. How cute. Sajjal, 
Leghari industries has thrown a party in the evening. Irha cannot come with me,
 I was thinking you come with me. So be ready? How can I go with you with mama around, 
Shaheer? Make an excuse, it is nothing big for you. You have no idea how typical mama is. She will never let me go, she will say no. Come on Sajjal, these things of helplessness sound 
weird coming from you. That is why I say, do something soon, 
so that these helplessness ends. Hmmm. Okay. Then I will tell Irha to get ready, because you said no. When did I say no? If you didn’t say no, then be ready.
 I will not take any excuses. Yes, but how will I convince her? That is something you need to think about. Just be ready in the evening and 
nothing should be lacking. Okay. Bye. Okay, bye. If I don’t go along, Irha will go. Now I will have to do something to stop Irha. she is really pretty. Right, Irha child? Live long. Hey, she doesn’t bother you, right Irha? She bothers me a lot. She cries all night long. Often Shaheer comes to ask me, 
why I am making his daughter cry. Don’t bother our princess, What did you name her? Shaheer wants to name her Fatima. Now what objection can I have on Shaheer’s choice. Fatima? it is a really good name. it is a blessed name. May God give her life, may He show her happiness with health. Greetings papa, when did you come? Child, I have been here for long. Okay. Where were you? You should be here with Irha and your mother. Papa, I was in the kitchen. Mama takes care of Fatima all day long, so I have to take care of Fatima. That’s why. Now once Irha gets fine, you pack your bag and come home. 
You have lived here for so long. Oh my lovely child…She is so good, 
she is so pretty. A lot. She takes up after Shaheer. No. No. See, she has delicate features like Irha. 
Huh? Sajjal, you do one thing, pack my bag quickly. I will go home with your father. Your uncle Aslam is really unwell, 
he is in the hospital. Why? What happened to uncle? Hey, he had a heartattack and 
we will go straight to the hospital from here. The doctor has suggested a surgery to him,
 right? Yes. Yes, you don’t worry at all about Irha.
 I will take care of Irha and I will also take care of Fatima as well. Okay? Fine. 
You people go and check on uncle. He really needs you people. You people don’t worry, 
we will manage everything ourselves. In fact, if you need anything, 
then I will ask Shaheer to do that as well. Hey, no child, we don’t need anything. You just take care of yourself and the princess. Should I help you with the packing mama? 
Go. Come on. She has gone to sleep, Irha. She has gone to sleep. Oh, hey. Oh God. You were saying it is really hard for you to come, or do you enjoy me being restless? Maybe fate also helps those who love. That is why all paths get cleared as well. Didn’t aunt ask you? She has left, 
and she wont even come for a few days. Oh, so we are free from the chains of the cruel world. We can live freely now. Exactly. Good. What is this noise at 2 am? You haven’t slept till now, Irha? I was sleeping, I woke up by your noise, and it is good I woke up. You shouldn’t stand up for so long, come I will drop you to your room…
you don’t need to care for me. If you were so caring towards me, 
then you should have been with me and my daughter. You wouldn’t be laughing here like this at 2 am 
with your brother in law. You are getting upset for no reason. I stopped her actually. I am not getting upset, Shaheer. Where were you since evening? Did you even come to check on me, once? Irha, actually a friend of mine called. I had to go to meet her. 
I totally forget to tell you. You surprise me, Sajjal. She was so worried,
 you should have at least sent a message. Yes, I made a mistake. I am so sorry, Irha. Sajjal, where is the earring from one of your ears? I forgot it in the room. Today Fatima will meet her father. She will surprise her father. She will give him a lot of love. Everything has changed so much, right? It feels like we are not going to his room after months, but after generations to his room. Yes, madam, did you call me? Yes, get all my clothes shifted to my room. We will live there from today. And Fatima will live with her father. 
Now Fatima has come in our life. Papa will love Fatima a lot, right? My Fatima. My life. See, papa’s room is here. You surprise me, Sajjal. She was so worried, 
you should have at least sent a message. Yes, I made a mistake. I am so sorry, Irha. Sajjal, where is the earring from one of your ears? I forgot it in the room. Brother Shakur, this belongs to Sajjal. What? Brother Shakur, does this belong to Sajjal? That is why I told you
 to send your sister to her home. She is trying to take your place. How long has this been going on for? Since you have fallen ill, since then. Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier, 
brother Shakur? Madam Irha, it was not my place. The situation has gone out of your thinking. Sabira has caught those two red handed, 
several times. That is why madam Sajjal turned against Sabira. And not just this, but I am completely sure that madam Sajjal 
got Sabira jailed in a false allegation of theft. Madam Irha, she scared me a lot, 
she threatened me. The truth is that I got scared because Mr. Shaheer sees with madam Sajjal’s eyes 
and listens through her ears. And madam Sajjal goes around 
Mr. Shaheer all the time.
