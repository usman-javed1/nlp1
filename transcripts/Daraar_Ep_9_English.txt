We have caught a lot of criminals. Most of them 
have been involved in different robberies, and if we had taken the girl’s statement, that would have been better. By the way, who were those three 
boys on the motorcycle? It is better for her to know. Inspector, 
right now Irha is going through a trauma, and I don’t want that 
your questions worry her further. That is why I have brought Mr. Hamid along, 
you can ask him whatever questions you want. We have taken his statement, but a victim’s statement is far important than
 a witness’s statement. By the way, Miss Irha must have surely 
seen the face of the one who shot her, and she will surely recognize him
 after seeing him. How can you say this with so much surety? The CCTV footage we have taken out, the face of that boy is a little visible. And if Miss Irha sees him once then she will surely recognize him. It will also make it easy for us. I am sure, Irha will surely recognize him, because Irha
 has great memory since childhood. Think about it uncle. I don’t want that
 it increases tension in future. Shaheer son, 
it is our responsibility to get the criminals punished, and this is not possible without Irha’s help. Fine, 
you WhatsApp me that footage. If she recognizes them, then fine. 
If she is not able to recognize them, then it is your responsibility and
 you have to fulfil it. No sir, you rest assured. You trust us. 
you will not get a chance to complain from us. Thank you inspector. Can we leave? Mr. Shaheer, if you see those criminals once, then maybe it will be easy for you too. Sure. Come on. Thank you inspector. Ali, where is Shahrukh? I don’t know, he has not been coming to university 
for the past two to three days. Really? His phone is also off for the past 
two to three days. Where can he be? I don’t know. I have no idea. 
We thought you would know. No, I didn’t get in touch with him for two to three days. 
Okay, I will find out from his family. Okay, bye. Bye. Hello. Yes, Rida. Do you know anything about Shahrukh? Really. No, I didn’t talk to him 
for two to three days, his phone is off. There is no contact. Oh, even you don’t know. Okay, no problem. I will find out. Okay, thank you. Bye. The police has caught a few people. If you can recognize anyone of them,
 then it will be really easy to catch those people. Try that we find a clue. Shaheer Ahmad is absolutely right, you will have to help the police. I will try my best, uncle. Uncle, we should go to the police station. Son, we cannot take Irha 
to the police station in this condition. No uncle, she will not go. We will get on a video call from there. if she recognizes even one of them, 
then we will not have a problem in catching the rest. In fact, I will do one thing, 
I will call Sajjal to come here from university. She can stay with her, then we will go. She would have come from university,
she will be tired. Why do you bother her?
 I will take care of myself. You people go. I will do one thing, I will call the inspector 
to have the video call here. She will not have to be bothered. If this can be done, it would be great. He is not picking up. If there is a problem, I will call the nurse.
 You people please go. Okay, fine. Come on. Sajjal? Sajjal, what are you doing here? Where are you for so many days?
 Your number is off, Shahrukh. You are not even coming to the university. What happened? Look, Iet me call you when I get free. I will tell you everything,
 but right now I cannot tell you anything. But what happened? Tell me something, at least.
 What is the issue? I cannot tell you right now. Please leave from here right now
 or both of us will get in trouble. Why can you not tell me?
 What happened? Murder. What? Murder? Whose murder? Come inside. Who has been murdered? 
What happened? Who did you kill? Look, I didn’t shoot anyone on purpose, the gun fired on its own. 
You have to believe me, I am innocent. Shahrukh, I don’t understand anything, 
where did you get a gun from? Me and a few friends went on an adventure, and then everything went wrong. Someone loses their life for fun? What are you saying?
 I don’t understand anything. You…if the police comes after 
you what will you do? have you thought about it? Did you say anything to your dad?
 Did you tell him anything? Right now, I cannot say anything to anyone. Please, you too leave from here. How can I leave from here? I love you. My love will get you trouble. Go, search the whole home. Check inside. Check properly. Shit. Who is this? What is happening? Shahrukh, tell me something. Police. Police? Look, we know you are inside. If you want to save your life, then open the door or else we will break the door 
and come inside. How is my daughter now? Does it hurt a lot? I am much better than before. You tell me, 
did you people go to the police station? I got a good news for you. The criminals got caught? He will get caught. Shaheer has gone to his home 
address himself. But why did Shaheer go himself? You should have told him not to. Child, I had told him not to. He says that till the time I don’t catch him
 by the collar and hand him to the police, I will not sit peacefully. But uncle, 
Shaheer shouldn’t have gone himself. God forbid if something goes wrong,
then? No child, the SHO went himself,
 the whole force went with him. You just pray that everything goes fine. You did all this, right? Me? I will bring the police? What is wrong with you? 
You are doubting me? Before today the police
 has never come outside my door, then how did they suddenly come today? how can you even think this, 
Shahrukh? Why would I bring the police? I love you. Fine. You love me, right? Then come on. 
Come to the police station with me. No. No. I cannot go. 
Have you gone mad? My family will drag me out of my home. Take me out of here. 
Is here a door here? Listen, you love me, right? Come with me, No, I don’t want to go.
 No. No. Look, I will count till three. If you don’t come out till I count till three, then I will shoot. One, two…. One second. One second. Come on. Search the home quickly. See if he has any other accomplices? Go quickly. You go this way. Hasn’t Sajjal come till now? No. it is possible 
she went straight home from university. I will call her. Uncle, 
ask the doctors to please discharge me. What are you saying, child? Till the doctors don’t allow you, you will have to stay here. I am bored lying here. I can even rest at home. Please ask him to let me go. 
Look, Irha child, you know 
what Shaheer Ahmad was saying? He says that till the time Irha doesn’t regain complete health,
 she will stay in the hospital. And I will support him in this matter. 
Okay? I will call Sajjal. Also ask Shaheer if he is fine.
 Yes, child, I will also call Shaheer. 
First let me call Sajjal. God, please help me. Just get me out of this problem, somehow. Oh God, please. Please. Please. She is not answering her phone. I will call again. Sir, there is a girl here as well. Okay, so you he hid the girl here. Sir, I found a girl here. Sir. You keep an eye on him. I didn’t do anything.
 I didn’t do anything. Please, let me go home. Please. 
Brother, let me go home. Sir, 
this is the other accomplice of that boy, who I am sure 
was involved in illegal activities with him. Now you tell sir everything honestly. I didn’t do anything, I want to go home. 
Please, I am telling you the truth. 
Please. Please let me go home. Please. Everyone says the same thing after getting caught. Now you will tell us everything quickly 
when you go to the police station. I didn’t do anything, please. Madam,
 if you want us to be lenient with you, then tell us everything yourself. Or we will have to inform your family. Then think you will get badly defamed
 because of it. Tell me, 
who else is involved in this game apart from you two. Sir, there was no one.
 I just want to go home. Please… Take her. Come on madam. Bring her. Come on. Move. Move. Come on, move. Move. I didn’t do anything, what are you… Shaheer, you? Sajjal, what are you doing here? Do you people know each other? No, I don’t know why they brought me. I am not involved. I don’t understand anything.
 Save me, please. Tell me, what are you doing here? Do you know 
this boy made a murder attempt on Irha. What? Shahrukh, shot Irha… He shot her. But what are you doing with him?
 and how did you get here? I will tell you everything honestly, 
please take me out of here. Please. Shahrukh.. SHO, this is Irha’s sister, she has nothing to do with
 this boy or his group. Let her go. Be careful Mr. Shaheer, what if there is a problem in the future. Let us be a little satisfied. I am satisfied. They are sisters and 
they live in the same home. And then why would 
she support her sister’s criminal? Look, 
nowadays no one is true to each other. Let us investigate this girl a little. Shahrukh is my class fellow. 
I don’t know all this. Why would I do it? Irha is my sister, 
I cannot do it. Shaheer take me out of here… I trust you. I trust you. Please. Mr. SHO, he is the criminal, 
she just came to meet him. You investigate him, 
he will tell you everything. and the attack
on your fiancée can be a result of jealousy. What are you saying? Shahrukh, 
why don’t you tell all of them the truth? What do I have to do with all this? Shahrukh, you tell them the truth. 
Why are you not saying anything? Sajjal is right. She has nothing to do with this accident. She didn’t even know that
 I have made the attack. Did you people hear it? Fine, you can take her. Hey, come on, make him sit in the car. 
Come on. Take him along. If you support them,
 I will not leave you. Come on. There is a limit to carelessness. Hey, where does Sajjal keep her phone and forget. Hey, Shaheer Ahmad is calling. Yes, son Shaheer, go ahead. Really? Oh wow. Fine son, 
I will come to the police station right now. Child, it is a good news for you. Your criminal has been caught. Uncle, this is really a good news. I am going to the police station. I don’t know where this Sajjal is, 
she is not answering her phone. I will ask Noshaba, she will come to you. Hey, why do you worry? I am fine now. You go, you go without worrying. 
Nothing will happen to me. What are you saying, child? God gave you a second life. Thank God your criminals have been caught. I will get them the most strict punishment. Irha, child, Shaheer is a really good man. Really sincere. Care for him. He is someone who cares for relations, 
he is decent and respectable man. Only people with good fate find such men. Okay? I am going to the police station. I will not leave him. Do you have any idea that 
had I not come today what the police would have done to you? They would have taken you to the police station, 
they would have called the media, you wouldn’t be able to face anyone in the city. Sajjal, do you have any idea 
what your parents would have gone through. How can you be an enemy of your respect? 
Did you really not feel scared? For God’s sake. Please, don’t tell my family anything. Papa will kill me. Please, take me out of this in anyway, 
please. You should have realized this earlier,
 Sajjal. How can you even meet such a person 
who is involved in a crime? I swear to God, I didn’t know that Shahrukh is such a boy. If I had known that he attacked Irha,
 then would I have come to meet him here? I really don’t know 
this Shahrukh who can take someone’s life. Who can rob someone. Okay, stop crying. Calm down and tell me, 
how long do you know this boy for? And Sajjal, the truth can save your life and respect too. So tell me. He studies with me in university. He was not coming over for two to three days, 
I got worried, so I just went to his home. So how do you know about this home? These people don’t live here. Shahrukh did his birthday,
 he called us friends. I just came once then, 
and the second time today. You take an off from 
your university for a few days. I will talk to the SHO and 
get this matter sorted. Please. Please, don’t tell my family 
or Irha about this. Please. I won’t. But if something like this happens, 
then it will be really difficult for me to hide it. I cannot reach to help you all the time. Drop me here. I will go home. No, I will drop you myself. Now I cannot take the risk of leaving you alone. Thank you. Shaheer is doing all this as 
my future brother in law and I… What are you thinking? Nothing. Where were you? Where were you? Stop asking me this question. When papa asks me, I will tell him. I have a really bad headache,
 I am going to rest for a while. The dinner needs to be cooked, 
it has to be taken to the hospital, and if it is not made, 
your father will create a scene. I am not cooking any food. I told you,
I have a headache, I need to rest for a while. I know everything. You don’t know anything. Quiet! Where were you all day long? If I ask you for something small,
 it raises hell. Yes, you look like someone from an innocent 
and decent family. And you. You look like their leader. Who are you? Who are you? 
You too are involved with them. You too are involved. Huh? How long have you people been doing this for? How many robberies have you people committed?
How many people have you robbed? Tell me everything or else I will call your parents here and show them your reality. Tell me everything, honestly. I am telling you. I will you everything. Sir, please. Please forgive us. We made a mistake. You made a mistake? You made a mistake? Now you remember your mistake? Did you not understand this earlier? The result of doing these things has a bad end. I made a mistake. Sir. Sir, we will tell you. We will tell you everything. Sir, please. You will tell me everything honestly. Yes, sir. Khan Mohammad. Yes, sir? Record their statement. I will come meet them in a while. Okay sir. Yes. Tell me everything honestly. You shouldn’t have gone there, Shaheer. If something had happened, then? What would have happened? Anything could have happened. If the police and criminal had a fight,
 a gun was fired… what was the need for you to go. For me, the most important thing 
was to get your criminals caught. For that even if I had to play on my life,
 I would have. What are you saying? God forbid something happens to you
ever. I pray that you get my age too. I don’t want a life where you are not there. I want to live with you forever I live. And our life has still not started and 
you are talking about dying. Do you love me so much? Love is not the right word. What I feel for you, to express that emotions, 
word won’t be enough. Just never be worried 
of the intensity of my love. Okay, don’t be so filmy. Tell me, who were those boys? Spoiled brats of rich parents. Who consider robbery 
as fun in the name of adventure. It is something so wrong. It sure it. But what do those poor parents know. They send their children to college to study, and how would they know 
what they do they in the name of education. Yes. Son, there is a good news for you. The doctor is saying 
they will release you from the hospital tomorrow. Thank God. This is a good thing. I will send the car in the morning,
it will drop you people home. In fact, do one thing, 
keep the car with you till you need it. Shaheer son, thank you very much.
 It is enough if the driver drops us home. Son, 
all that you have done for Irha and for us, we cannot thank you. Live long, son. Uncle, please.
 Irha is now my responsibility. What did you do, Shahrukh? You were going to ruin me with you. Thank God, Shaheer came there or else the police would have taken me along. I wouldn’t have been able to face anyone. Papa, please. Papa, please, take me out of here.
 Papa, I have not done anything. Please. I have seen the list of your adventures
with my own eyes. You don’t need to say anything. I feel disgusted calling you my son. I am sorry, papa. I am really sorry. You take me out of here once,
 I will fix everything, papa. Papa, please take me out of here today. Your bail has been rejected. You cannot be released without the court’s order. What do you mean it got rejected? Papa, please take me out of here.
 How can you do this with me? They are powerful people,
 the orders have come from their seniors. I cannot do anything. Use your sources. How can you let me stay here?
 Papa, please. I am. I am. I am trying.
I will go and call again. Pray that God has mercy. You talk to Sajjal once, she can help us. She will talk to her family, papa. Sajjal? Who, Sajjal? She is my friend. The girl I shot, she is her sister. Do you have her address? No. But I have her number. I will give you her number, you talk to her. 
You try to convince her, papa, please. Tell me. Careful. Come. Carefully. So many flowers? Such pretty flowers.
 Who sent them? Who can spend so much on flowers 
other than Shaheer Ahmad? You know, we can get a month’s grocery at 
our home in so much money. Come on, Irha. I will drop you in your room. Okay wait. Once you drop her at her home, keep all these flowers in her room. What if the neighbours see it and think that Hamid Ali has started a flower business. Sure, mama. Hey, Noshaba, be happy for a change. Don’t you see, 
they are such pretty flowers. We will have to agree to something that 
Shaheer Ahmad has a great choice. And I don’t need to worry about the neighbours. They can say what they want. I don’t care about anyone. Yes, I have a good idea of his madness seeing all this. Hey, be quiet for a change. Don’t you see, Irha has returned home after so long. 
You are always speaking nonsense. Come on. Careful. Slowly. Sit here comfortably. Here. 
Sit comfortably. Watch out. Okay, you rest here, 
I will bring something for you to eat. Okay listen, I don’t feel like eating anything. Just keep the flowers outside, in the room. They will die in the sun. You are really worried about the flowers. Did you ever think that 
you would get someone as loving as Shaheer Ahmad so easily? You know, he is crazy after you. Should I consider it a taunt or a praise? Hah, if you want to consider it,
then consider it my desire. It can be any girl’s dream. It seems like a dream to me. It is a reality, but as beautiful as a dream. Did you find out anything about that criminal?
 Did Shaheer tell you something? Yes, he told me everything. What? What did he tell you? That the criminals got caught on spot and the proceeding will be done further, 
and… What happened? Why are you so worried?
 Is everything fine? No. No. Why would I worry? Such a big accident happened,
so I need to ask. Anyway, leave all this. You rest here, I will bring your flowers. Hello. Yes, who is this? This is Sajjad. Shahrukh’s father. Yes, uncle. Go ahead. Why did you call me? It is because child, 
only you can save Shahrukh. What can I do uncle? Whatever Shahrukh did was wrong, 
and he will get punished for it. Child, we are really worried. His bail has been rejected. You do anything and convince your family or else my son’s future will be ruined. No uncle, I cannot do anything. If my family finds out that he is from my class,
 then they will make me sit at home. I cannot do this at all. Your sister survived, right? So you can make one attempt to save Shahrukh. Look, child, 
I will not forget this favour of yours all my life. Please. Please. Okay fine, 
I will try but I cannot make any promises. Goodbye. No need to be scared grandma. That boy was no illiterate person, he is from a good family. Educated. Scary, if these boys do this. Excuse me, grandma. Yes, Sajjal, go ahead. Is everything fine? Shaheer, 
I want to talk to you about something important. I am listening. Shahrukh’s father called. Shahrukh’s bail has been rejected, 
he is really worried. So they should be, what can we do? I know what Shahrukh did was wrong, but if Shahrukh’s bail is rejected then
it will be worse. He will be rusticated from the university, 
his family won’t accept him, his life will be ruined. Please, do something. You are taking the side of the 
boy who made a murder attempt on your sister? I am disappointed. How can you even think this? He didn’t know it was Irha, and after all the gun fired by mistake. And thank God, it didn’t do a lot of damage. I am sorry, Sajjal, but I am not in the mood 
to be lenient with that boy in this matter. Shahrukh’s father will get him out on bail, but if you would have…
His father can do what he wants, then I will do what I want. What happened? 
Something to worry about? No, grandma. All this goes on. You tell me, 
when are you going to meet Irha? tomorrow. In fact, when I go, 
I will also fix the wedding. What do you think? 
Why ask before doing a good deed. If it was in my control, I would have made her 
my bride and brought her home today. Is your tea cold? Hello. Look uncle, I have spoken to him already. 
He cannot do anything in this matter. You stop bothering me. Thank you. Goodbye. Who was on the phone? And why are you so worried? No. No. A friend called. 
She was asking about Irha. Okay, so you too have made an announcement throughout
 Pakistan like your father. Huh? Every other person is coming to see her 
or they are eating my brains by calling on the phone. Mama, such a big accident happened, 
so people will ask. Okay. Okay. If you are so interested in having a crowd here, then come and serve them too. People from the neighbourhood have come,
 make tea and bring it. And bring it soon. What if you keep on sitting here, 
thinking and they leave.
