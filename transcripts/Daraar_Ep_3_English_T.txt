[31.92] Irha,
[33.84] what happened, child?
[38.24] I am thanking my God, aunt.
[41.72] His blessings are so vast,
[45.08] that blesses a person before 
he falls in the quicksand of failure.
[51.96] That is all fine,
[53.68] but tell me what happened?
[57.12] I got a job, 
and I also got a really good package.
[61.28] They have also allotted a home along with it.
[63.96] Really?
[65.56] Thank God.
[68.44] Congratulations to you.
[70.64] Your hard work has paid off, child.
[73.08] All this is a result of your prayers,
[75.52] or else I had given up.
[79.12] You will see that
[81.52] I will pray for you day and night,
[83.64] and you will progress a lot.
[87.84] Come let’s bow down in front of God 
and thank Him.
[93.36] God, it is a favour You did on us. Thank God.
[99.08] It is a big French fry, my love eat it. Eat it.
[102.32] Listen, go to the car and bring her milk.
[105.44] Yummy. Yummy.
[109.44] Why are you not eating?
[110.84] If you don’t like it, then order something else.
[112.88] No, I am not in the mood.
[114.60] What is the need to spoil your mood 
on something so small?
[118.16] Something small?
[121.40] What are you ruined?
[123.88] You have ruined all my clothes.
[125.96] You have no manners in you.
[128.16] All my clothes are ruined, 
my clothes are soaked in oil,
[131.88] and you are asking me 
why I have a bad mood.
[135.40] Whatever it is.
[136.56] You don’t like this with a young child.
[138.72] Such an expensive suit 
of mine has all the oil of the French fries on it,
[142.04] and you are saying I shouldn’t talk like this.
[144.16] I bought it for you, right?
[146.00] You didn’t buy it with your own pocket that 
you are feeling so much pain.
[149.68] Now you will also taunt me 
with the things you bought?
[154.48] I am just saying that 
we will get more clothes,
[156.72] you fix your behaviour towards her.
[158.48] Why? Should we not teach the 
difference between right and wrong?
[160.96] Should we not make her understand?
[165.76] There is a big difference between 
explaining with love and scolding,
[168.08] which I think is something you are forgetting.
[169.68] That is why I had told you not to bring her,
[171.80] but you are always interested in taking her 
along everywhere, all the time.
[178.20] You know what?
[180.44] You are right.
[182.20] We shouldn’t have come here.
[184.92] Let’s go home.
[186.40] Come on, child. Come. Come. Come.
[205.64] Sajjal.
[207.36] Sajjal, I am going for breakfast.
[209.16] Come on, come have breakfast with me.
[210.96] I am sleepy. Please, let me sleep.
[214.12] Come on, I am getting late for work. 
Please, come.
[217.80] Sajjal.
[218.84] Sajjal. Come on.
[220.04] What is it?
 If you are getting late then what can I do?
[221.84] I am not your maid that I stand in front of you
 early in the morning, to do your work.
[226.08] Let me sleep, I am sleepy.
[228.28] How are you talking to me?
[230.76] I told you, let me sleep. I am sleepy.
[305.16] Hello.
[306.88] Are you upset?
[308.88] Why? Shouldn’t I be?
[314.56] The way you insulted me last night, 
that too on something small.
[318.68] I just wanted to say that 
you don’t talk to such a small child like this.
[323.40] So I take care of her all day long,
[327.08] if I scolded her a little, 
do I not even have this much right?
[333.40] You proved that I am nothing to her.
[336.52] I didn’t mean that.
[340.20] Anyway, I am sorry.
[344.72] I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that.
[347.40] If you are tired of me, then tell me. 
I will make some arrangements for me.
[356.44] I am not Irha that 
I will tolerate this behaviour of yours.
[359.84] This will not happen again,
[361.52] I promise.
[366.08] But you don’t talk about leaving on everything.
[371.64] I cannot tolerate it.
[373.88] Tell me, why did you call?
[378.24] We have to go to a party in the evening,
[380.12] be ready.
[381.84] Whose party?
[384.00] The party of the owner of the 
Sultan Group of Companies.
[388.32] Our company wants to buy 
some shares from them.
[391.68] If this collaboration is done, we will win the lottery.
[394.80] I have tried to finalize the deal,
[396.60] we have to go for that.
[398.08] I want that nothing goes wrong.
[400.48] Okay fine, I will be ready.
[403.40] Okay. Listen,
[406.32] I love you.
[432.44] Hey, miss Irha you have still not gone home?
[435.68] Yes, madam a little work was left,
[438.40] I thought I would finish the work once and go.
[441.60] Our client left really happy from here.
[444.40] In fact, 
the way you have worked hard in the past few days,
[447.36] because of which our company has benefited a lot.
[450.48] Madam, I am just completing my tasks with 
full hard work and honesty. Nothing else.
[456.92] This is a big success for you.
[459.36] Thank you madam.
[461.20] What happened? 
You didn’t shift to your new home.
[463.56] Is there a problem?
[464.92] If there is, then please share it.
[467.20] Actually, I have a lot of memories with that home.
[472.32] Aunt also lives there,
[474.68] so that is why madam I was delaying it a little, 
nothing else.
[478.56] I see, as you wish.
[487.48] I too will see what you will be able to achieve, 
once Shaheer Ahmad’s label is removed from you.
[490.88] Shaheer, please…
[492.00] You still have time.
[493.72] If you love your child so much then 
quietly live with respect in this home.
[505.40] Shaheer, you were wrong.
[509.40] I had a recognition before meeting you 
and that is still there.
[517.68] Your companionship did 
show me a few bright days,
[525.20] but it also gave me a permanent sea of sorrows.
[530.36] But no sorrow you gave me,
[533.16] wasn’t able to make a deal on 
my self-respect and position.
[559.36] Brother,
[560.64] take a U-turn and stop at that shop.
[620.44] Greetings.
[621.40] Greetings madam. How are you?
[623.52] You visited after really long.
[625.12] I am fine. Is someone at home?
[627.92] No one is there.
[629.40] Mr. Shaheer
[631.08] and madam Sajjal went to a party,
[633.48] they will come late at night.
[635.96] and my daughter Fatima?
[638.20] She is at home. If you want to meet her, 
then go ahead. No one will find out anything.
[642.32] Thank you so much brother Karamdad.
[646.84] Thank you.
[648.48] Thank you.
[659.20] Yes, who are you?
[664.56] I am Fatima’s mother.
[669.04] Can you give me five minutes with her,
 alone?
[671.80] Yes, sure.
[688.08] Fatima,
[694.04] your mama has come.
[697.20] Happy birthday my love.
[700.08] Look,
[701.76] mama got a gift for you.
[705.28] Your mama came to wish you on your birthday.
[710.28] May God give you all the happiness of the world.
[717.24] May you never face any worry or pain.
[725.72] Your mama really loves you a lot.
[730.24] She really misses you.
[736.96] She is a little distant from you,
[740.92] but she always loves her 
Fatima even being away from her.
[748.96] You never be upset with your mother,
[752.88] don’t be misled about her. She is helpless,
[756.36] that is why she is far from you.
[760.44] Even being away from you, 
she wants to be with you all the time, Fatima.
[768.56] Mama loves you.
[774.20] Happy birthday.
[802.80] Shaheer, welcome.
[804.64] I am so glad to see you.
 It felt good that you came.
[807.32] Pleasure is all mine.
[809.16] After all, it is a lifelong partnership now.
[811.96] Along with business, 
I have also been really impressed with your courtesy.
[816.28] Thank you. Thank you.
[819.08] You have made the party lively by coming to it.
[824.48] Thank you.
[825.76] Thank you.
[827.20] How could I not come? 
You called me with so much love.
[832.24] You didn’t introduce her.
[834.12] Oh, Sultan, this is Sajjal, my girlfriend. Sajjal,
[837.68] Sultan.
[838.72] The tycoon of the chemical industry.
[840.92] Nowadays his name is famous
 in the stock market.
[845.88] You praised me a lot.
[849.08] Anyway, Sajjal,
[850.88] it is really nice to meet you.
[853.32] It felt good to meet you.
[855.56] Nice to meet you too.
[857.40] By the way he never praises you,
[859.80] but nowadays he really praises you.
[862.40] Why? Has he never praised you either?
[866.04] You know.
[868.28] you don’t need to be praised.
[873.12] Anyway, enjoy your drinks. Sure.
[876.52] and enjoy the party, 
I will see you guys in a while.
[878.72] Yeah, sure.
[888.68] Shaheer,
[892.20] why did you tell Sultan Khan that 
I am your girlfriend?
[897.76] Because everyone over here 
knows Irha is my wife,
[901.32] so…
[905.20] Excuse me.
[947.88] Hi Shaheer, how are you?
[950.76] Good to see you.
[953.12] I had told you I will meet you 
some day and now see.
[957.84] It felt good seeing you here.
[960.08] If you are free someday, 
let’s have lunch together.
[963.16] You know I cannot say no to you.
[966.40] But not today.
[968.24] Today I am Sultan Khan’s guest,
[973.72] I know,
[975.48] the world praises the rising sun.
[978.52] You are the same too.
[980.36] You saw a slight fair complexion and features,
[982.52] you forgot your wife’s faithfulness and
 fell for your sister in law?
[990.64] I will see you around.
[1007.36] I noticed you didn’t eat anything, 
should I bring something for you.
[1012.08] No. Thank you.
[1013.56] I will take something myself.
[1018.68] It felt good to meet you.
[1021.44] I do hope we meet again.
[1023.88] Why are you embarrassing me?
[1025.60] You are really intelligent,
[1028.20] and beautiful too.
[1032.16] Shaheer had to lose his heart seeing you.
[1036.44] Anyway,
[1037.84] what keeps you busy nowadays, 
apart from being Shaheer’s girlfriend?
[1042.28] What?
[1045.88] Why don’t you partner up 
with Shaheer in the business?
[1050.12] Shaheer doesn’t like it.
[1052.44] Hi is really smart,
[1056.72] he knows when to use whom. 
He is very sharp.
[1063.32] Will you have coffee with me?
[1067.36] Sure.
[1068.60] Whenever Shaheer is free, 
we will make a plan.
[1071.32] Not with Shaheer.
[1073.92] I want to meet you alone.
[1077.20] I am surprised that Shaheer has a girl like you locked up
 in the four walls of the home.
[1084.04] You are the one whom every eye in the 
world should praise.
[1089.88] You probably don’t know what your worth is.
[1094.12] I didn’t understand what you said.
[1096.20] You will when the time comes.
[1098.60] But I am hoping to see you again.
[1103.08] Your stars are really shining bright
[1106.76] or else you would never be 
able to win from me in chess.
[1123.20] My luck has always been good.
[1126.64] Even if I touch sand it turns to gold.
[1129.72] It was different earlier.
[1132.32] The whole city used to praise Shaheer Ahmad,
[1135.92] but he too seems restless to 
do a partnership with you.
[1139.92] What magic have you done that 
he is sitting in your feet?
[1146.44] Just think that it took hard work 
of a lot of years to bring Shaheer to this point.
[1152.68] He was really arrogant.
[1155.00] He had the passion to be number one.
[1158.64] He didn’t let anyone progress.
[1161.68] But now I will ruin him
[1164.92] in a way that he too wouldn’t be able to find
 out whose hand is behind him being ruined.
[1168.88] Sultan Khan,
[1170.88] it is not that easy to defeat Shaheer Ahmad.
[1173.92] This is all things of the past.
[1177.92] Now the situation of Shaheer’s home
[1181.36] and business are really fragile.
[1185.52] Now he cannot save himself even if he wants to.
[1191.64] Sultan.
[1206.36] Sajjal, listen to me as well.
[1208.52] What is left to listen to?
[1211.24] You have insulted me calling me your girlfriend.
[1214.84] So I will call you what you are.
[1216.40] So why don’t you give this relationship a name?
[1218.32] Why have you kept it without a name?
[1219.52] You know it is not possible for me.
[1221.32] Then I too don’t need to go 
with you anywhere in future.
[1224.44] I am tired of this daily insult. Do you have 
any idea how people were looking at me?
[1229.60] I felt disgusted on myself.
[1231.40] You are blowing things 
out of proportions for no reason.
[1251.24] Has she gone to sleep?
[1252.20] Yes, madam.
[1256.36] What is all this? Who brought it?
[1259.88] Madam, madam Irha brought all this.
[1263.24] Irha brought it?
[1264.60] How dare she come to this home,
[1266.60] and how did you let her come inside the home?
[1268.88] No. No, madam, she didn’t come in the home.
[1270.88] She gave all this on the doorstep and went.
[1273.04] So why did you take all this,
 why did you not throw it in her face?
[1277.44] What is the matter? 
Why are you getting so upset?
[1279.92] Did you see how much courage this woman had.
[1282.28] See this, what has she brought?
[1283.88] How dare she come to this home?
[1286.04] What does she want to prove that 
she loves her daughter?
[1289.12] Huh?
[1291.48] Irha came here?
[1292.92] Yes, sir.
[1294.60] I am telling you I cannot tolerate all this.
[1297.24] You tell her that she cannot come to this home.
[1300.68] If she steps in this home,
 I will push her out of here. And you.
[1305.24] You too listen to me carefully,
[1307.04] in future she cannot even step in this home.
[1309.56] Sure.
[1310.84] Come on, Sajjal,
[1312.72] she is her mother,
[1314.08] she can come meet her when she wants.
[1316.32] If she was the mother, 
then why did she leave her and go?
[1318.96] She should have taken her along. 
What does she want to prove?
[1322.92] You are overreacting for no reason.
[1325.08] Don’t forget it was my decision to drag her out
and keep Fatima here.
[1329.88] Why are you sympathizing with her so much?
[1331.80] What do you want to say?
Do you want to call her back?
[1337.76] You are saying something wrong.
[1339.40] The truth is always bitter.
[1342.28] And you, pick up all this and throw it out.
[1345.56] Nothing will go anywhere.
[1347.64] Her mother brought it.
[1349.64] She has a right to keep these things with her.
[1351.76] What are you saying, Shaheer?
[1353.84] You are favouring the woman…
I am not favouring anyone,
[1357.72] I am just trying to make you understand…
I don’t want to hear or understand anything.
[1359.80] That woman cannot come to this home.
[1362.08] I have said it, that’s it.
[1372.16] Sit down.
[1406.20] That’s fantastic news.
[1407.84] Great. Fix me a meeting with Sultan.
[1410.72] That is fine, sir, but think about it once more.
[1414.52] Should we buy their shares like this, suddenly?
[1419.40] Why shouldn’t we buy them?
[1421.04] If we buy the shares at a low price, 
and sell them at a high price,
[1422.72] that’s how we will recover our losses.
[1424.72] You are right, sir.
[1426.44] But I think we should have waited a little.
[1430.04] Sultan group of companies 
doesn’t have an impressive past record, sir.
[1435.16] Look, it was different earlier,
[1436.56] but right now their company’s standing is really good.
[1439.60] All the businessmen are willing to buy his shares.
[1442.92] And we are lucky that 
he giving us this opportunity himself.
[1446.16] I just want to say, sir.
[1448.56] We have nothing in backup.
[1451.36] What if we have to face a big loss.
[1454.88] We would have to take a risk, Noman,
[1456.56] and this is not the first time, 
we have always been doing that.
[1460.28] The company’s condition has 
not been like this ever again, sir.
[1462.92] That’s is why I am taking a risk.
[1464.84] I want good days for the company to return again.
[1467.04] For that it is necessary to have this deal finalized.
[1469.32] So get the meeting fixed.
[1470.88] Sir, Miss Irha’s property documents are ready,
[1475.56] what do we do about that?
[1476.68] I have spoken to the lawyer about that, 
he will look into it.
[1478.60] You focus on the meeting.
[1480.16] I want it done. Okay.
[1491.48] Last night for the first time in my life,
 I was proud of Shaheer Ahmad.
[1497.36] What was that for?
[1499.72] That damned has some great luck.
[1502.88] He has got the companionship of a best 
of girls every time.
[1506.32] But this time something amazing has happened, 
she is not a girl,
[1509.56] she is a magic. A magic.
[1512.76] No matter how much magic she can cast,
[1514.96] whenever Shaheer Ahmad sees a prettier face,
[1519.28] he will move towards her.
[1521.60] He is not faithful to anyone.
[1525.08] With such a girl, 
who will be the sinner who can even look at another girl?
[1530.88] Because he only has one drug,
[1534.48] and to get it,
[1536.28] he can put everything he has on the line.
[1538.76] It is possible, 
but this time the girl he got is something different.
[1547.76] We will see,
[1550.20] if something different will happen this time
[1553.04] or will history repeat itself?
[1555.64] Fine, if that’s how it is, 
then I will also try playing.
[1581.16] Hello.
[1582.88] Hello.
[1584.56] Who is it?
[1587.16] I am Sultan.
[1589.40] Where did you get my number from?
[1592.12] You even find God when you search,
[1595.40] and I have found you, 
the number is something ordinary.
[1600.36] Why did you call?
[1602.64] My wish to have coffee with 
you has not been fulfilled till now.
[1606.96] I still haven’t spoken to Shaheer.
[1612.04] So he has you imprisoned that 
you cannot go anywhere without his will.
[1617.52] Very sad.
[1618.88] There is nothing like that. 
I…There shouldn’t be anything like that.
[1622.52] You are not his wife that
 he can boss you around.
[1625.48] You are smart, you are beautiful,
[1627.72] you shouldn’t put yourself in useless restrictions.
[1631.84] You have not been made to be locked in home,
[1634.56] in fact, you are the diamond that
[1636.32] every eye should praise.
[1640.12] So are you coming?
[1642.56] For what?
[1645.04] I want to discuss something.
[1647.28] I have a really good opportunity for you.
[1650.64] Where do you want to meet?
[1652.20] I will send you the location.
[1654.44] We will meet tomorrow. Take care.
[1664.24] Should I go or not? I should go,
[1670.16] yes. Shaheer’s behaviour is changing 
with me day by day.
[1674.80] At least I should find out
the proposal Sultan has for me.
[1711.32] Hey Sajjal, how are you?
[1714.80] Greetings.  Greetings.
[1717.72] We could have met somewhere outside, 
why did you call me here?
[1720.52] It was not suitable to meet outside, 
if someone had seen us, then what would you have told Shaheer?
[1725.16] And I only invite special people to my home.
[1728.72] Really?
[1729.92] Since when did I become special for you?
[1732.12] Since I saw you, I met you.
[1736.56] Once Sultan Khan looks at someone then that 
person doesn’t stay ordinary.
[1743.48] Impressive. Please.
[1745.16] Please have a seat.
[1746.48] Thank you.
[1749.20] You are impressive Sajjal.
[1751.16] I was looking for such a bold and confident girl.
[1754.20] You know I was really worried before coming here.
[1757.88] I was thinking if I should meet you or not?
[1759.76] Oh come on, now you are not a sixteen
 year old girl that you worry so much.
[1764.88] and after all, I called you here for your benefit.
[1768.28] You are in the company of Sultan Khan.
[1771.12] So please, just relax.
[1775.52] Well, coming here I see some benefit.
 I like it here now.
[1785.32] I knew you would know 
your importance by coming here.
[1788.56] Something Shaheer 
has never been able to give you.
[1791.20] So was the objective of this meeting as to meet me?
[1796.44] Sultan Khan can do anything to make a
 beautiful girl like you his partner.
[1801.96] Partners?
[1803.60] Yes.
[1805.68] Now we will become business partners.
[1811.56] This was the objective of this meeting.
[1825.12] Since I have met you, I have been thinking the same thing, 
that what you saw in a man like Shaheer Ahmed.
[1830.44] I mean you could have got the best of men,
[1835.08] then why your married brother in law?
[1841.92] This is a personal matter of mine,
 I…Come on, buddy.
[1847.28] We will now be business partners,
[1850.80] what is the secrets that you are keeping.
[1853.20] After all,
[1854.56] I am not used to any formalities in relations.
[1860.40] How do you know
 what relation I have with Shaheer?
[1865.96] The whole business community knows, 
in fact, people also say that
[1870.28] since Shaheer left his wife,
[1873.48] he has to face loss after loss.
[1877.20] Maybe he got his wife’s curse.
[1881.64] There is nothing like that.
[1883.76] Those two didn’t have an understanding, that’s it.
[1888.28] Oh so this is what he saying and fooling you.
[1900.60] I didn’t understand what you were saying.
[1903.88] Sir, food is ready.
[1907.36] Fine, you go.
[1909.80] Please.
[1921.52] What I meant to say was that 
you are a really decent and naïve girl.
[1926.08] You don’t know what your worth is, Sajjal.
[1928.76] That is why Shaheer Ahmad is taking advantage of you, 
he is fooling you.
[1932.36] He loves me,
[1934.12] how can he take advantage of me?
[1935.76] Hah,
[1937.00] love.
[1938.44] Shaheer just knows how to do business,
[1940.64] he doesn’t know anything about love.
[1943.44] The man who cannot take care 
of the mother of his daughter,
[1946.64] how can he love?
[1949.04] Why don’t you say it clearly?
[1950.92] What do you want to say?
[1953.80] Have a seat. Come.
[1962.44] Thank you.
[1966.88] Just think.
[1969.64] Think about yourself.
[1972.64] Shaheer will be bankrupt really soon.
[1975.32] At most he has two to three days to survive.
[1980.20] That is why he is trying to buy 
my business shares.
[1984.56] That is why we will be business partners.
[1989.56] We should be business partners.
[1991.84] Why are you not talking to me clearly? Tell me.
[1998.24] Excuse me.
[2002.68] Mr. Jameel, I am in a very important meeting. 
Say what you have to quickly.
[2010.24] It cannot be less than five hundred million.
[2014.20] Yes, I have no objections.
[2016.52] Why don’t you set up my meeting with them 
and let me know. Okay?
[2020.88] Goodbye.
[2027.04] Sorry about that.
[2031.80] You are such a big businessman,
[2035.16] you could have invested with anyone.
[2039.32] We are those make two plus two into eight.
[2043.40] We are serving people.
[2048.80] God is blessing us, we are distributing it.
[2051.68] So will you invest with me?
[2054.96] You know, I don’t have that much money, but…
[2059.56] You don’t need to invest.
[2063.40] You just have to be my partner,
[2065.52] that’s it.
[2072.32] I need some time to think. Don’t worry.
[2076.16] You will pray for me all your life.
[2078.96] So can I take the papers and go home?
[2081.48] Of course, you have all the time in the world.
[2084.64] But you will only benefit partnering with me.
[2090.16] Oh wow.
[2092.80] Please start eating. Please.
[2097.92] Yes, sure.
[2116.84] Thank you.
[2120.72] This is a small gift from me for you.
[2124.92] What is this?
[2132.72] This is to our friendship.
[2135.24] When you wear it, its worth will increase.
[2140.16] No. No.
[2142.32] I cannot take this at all.
[2144.96] Please, I want you to have it.
[2147.28] I want that you keep my word.
[2153.88] After all, they say that 
giving gifts increases love and friendship.
[2164.20] Thank you.
[2166.44] I am starting to feel proud of your friendship.
[2171.92] Now you are going to be Sultan Khan 
and not Shaheer Ahmad’s partner.
[2176.28] So you need to be proud.
[2178.96] After all, that man never considered you 
capable to be his partner.
[2183.00] Thank you so much for doing all this.
[2187.52] I am doing all this for myself too.
[2190.96] How is that?
[2193.32] I have some old accounts to settle
 with Shaheer Ahmad.
[2196.84] So you want to use me?
[2200.52] Do you feel that?
[2202.88] Even if you want to, 
then everyone here is looking for their benefit.
[2207.08] If I too will benefit,
then we will surely meet again.
[2213.64] Where is sir?
[2214.52] Sir is on the dining table. Okay.
[2223.68] Hi Sultan.
[2226.44] Hi Zoya.
[2227.96] How are you? How are you?
[2230.44] Who are you?
[2233.16] She is my friend.
[2235.48] Why don’t you tell her honestly.
[2239.04] I am Shaheer’s ex-girlfriend.
[2243.36] Who at one time
 he would lay his life for just like you.
[2249.16] What?
[2258.88] All this is a lie.
[2264.80] This is not a lie.
[2266.36] This is the reality that neither you,
[2269.00] nor his wife Irha knows.
[2272.04] But seeing you I immediately understood that
[2274.76] every beautiful girl is his weakness.
[2277.56] What do you want to say?
[2280.92] I came to tell you some facts,
[2284.68] through which the eyes of a stupid girl like you 
would open.
[2288.52] What facts?
[2290.64] The things Shaheer hid from you.
[2295.68] What nonsense is this?
[2297.36] Shaheer loves me truly.
[2299.76] Why are you misleading me?
[2301.68] Huh?
[2303.20] Do you want to take some revenge from him?
[2305.36] What did he do to you?
[2308.72] You are really naïve,
[2310.84] or else you would never broke your sister’s home.
[2314.08] He had claimed to have loved me
 just like you at a time.
[2318.56] But neither did he marry me,
[2320.64] and nor was he faithful to me.
[2323.48] He married a faithful girl like Irha,
[2327.12] but he couldn’t be faithful.
[2330.56] So you…you came to take revenge.
[2333.40] So that I listen to you and leave Shaheer, right?
[2337.40] I only came to say something after I got ruined.
[2341.00] Get a grip.
[2343.40] The bird that likes going to every branch,
[2346.80] he can never be faithful.
[2350.91] This will never happen.
[2353.22] Shaheer has promised me.
[2355.40] He has unfaithfulness in his nature. 
Who do you have hopes from?
[2363.91] Anyway,
[2365.18] my responsibility was to tell you,
[2367.18] rest is up to you.
[2368.79] Because now if Shaheer finds out about me,
[2371.99] then I have no fear of him.
[2380.79] Listen,
[2382.60] can you stay for some time.
[2387.72] Can you tell me something more about Shaheer?
[2391.72] I can tell you so much that 
even Shaheer Ahmad doesn’t know about himself.
