I know being the father of a girl, it is not possible to respond quickly. But still give me some hope so that 
we are not disappointed and we can spend the tough time of the wait. What will Hamid Ali say? Your wish has surprised him. You tell me, are you giving us an order 
or are you asking for a proposal? I don’t understand Look, in our families,
 girls don’t get married by their liking. And if proposals come like this, they are not encouraged. This shamelessness must be
 common in affluent families like yours, we are decent people. You be quiet, Noshaba. Why should I be quiet? When the matter comes to your niece, 
you will break all your rules? If my daughter had done this, you would never have said yes. I told you to be quiet, Noshaba. This is the reason 
I used to tell you to be careful. If something wrong happens in future, we will not be able to face anyone. But you. You never listened to me. These affluent people 
get married in our homes happily, but when they get done, they leave you midway. What are you trying to say?
 I don’t understand? We are respectable people,
 why would we do this? Respectable people? The stories of respectable people 
partying are not hidden from us. Look, we are simple and decent people, and for God’s sake, have mercy on us. She is a child without parents, and if something happens in future, then we will be at risk on judgement day. Noshaba, be quiet. Go from here. Noshaba, I am telling you, 
leave from here. Madam, I am really embarrassed, my wife is really ill-mannered. I apologize on her behalf. Forgive us. No problem, Mr. Hamid Ali, I didn’t mind it at all. Because she doesn’t know me. But you don’t do this. I will wait for your yes. Live long, child. Take care. I will leave now. I knew it before hand that 
this girl will do something like this. See, the grandness she has got her hands on. She is following her mother’s footsteps. My heart is burning to ashes. How can Shaheer Ahmad 
send her proposal like this? What did he see in her? 
How did he like her? She knows the art of talking. She makes people her fan. She must have made him
 crazy after her. Mama, is there a misunderstanding? What are you saying? 
What misunderstanding? That grandmother, she has even made her, 
her fan. Can you stop this proposal somehow? Do anything and say no to this proposal. 
Please mama, for my sake. Hey, I have tried a lot, 
but your father insulted me and sent me away. Did he say yes? Did you see your aunt’s adventure and you still want that 
I don’t marry you? Child, now it is necessary for you to get married. Shaheer Ahmad 
has expressed his liking with a lot of love. Think hard and decide. What if he likes some other 
girl tomorrow and he…. You believe me uncle? More than myself. Then believe me, I didn’t encourage Shaheer Ahmad 
even a little in the matter of marriage. I didn’t even know
 those people would send a proposal. I know child. That is why I am saying, whatever you decide, think hard. What if we have to regret later. So I have made my decision. I will get married by your will, you say no to Shaheer Ahmad. I do not accept Shaheer Ahmad’s proposal. You say no to them. Yes, grandma. Tell me quickly, 
what did Irha say? You were really waiting restlessly. Oh sorry, I didn’t see the number. I am the one who should say sorry,
Shaheer Ahmad. You sent a proposal without thinking. Without knowing 
if she is interested in you or not. I don’t understand. 
What do you want to say? For your betterment, 
I want to tell you that me and Irha are cousins and we live in the same home. And where you are together since childhood, you cannot hide anything even
if you want to. Sajjal, talk clearly, why are you talking in riddles? Irha has said no to the proposal. What? How is this possible? Nothing is impossible for a girl like Irha. She has a habit of giving surprises. There must be a reason for the refusal. Do I lack something…
I asked her the same thing, and so did mama. She is just insisting on one thing that 
she doesn’t want to marry a flirt like you. And even papa agreed to her. He also says the same thing,
 that people like you, rich people, they are flirtatious. What? Is Irha out of her mind? Her fate is bad. Or else can someone say no 
to a person like you? By the way you don’t lack girls. If you run after girls like Irha then
 they will show tantrums. Maybe you are right. We will have fun now. Now Shaheer Ahmad will find out the result 
of rejecting a beautiful girl like me and opting for an average girl like Irha. What did Irha’s family say? What will they tell us this early, 
child? They have asked for some time and
 they are not wrong either. A marriage is not a game, that they agree immediately. Why are you hiding it from me,
 grandma? Tell me the truth, 
that they have said no to your grandson. Who told you? What do you think? If you hide it from me, 
I will not find out? Why would I hide it from you? I don’t know what you are saying, 
I don’t understand. They will have to pay a high price for this refusal. If Irha is not mine, 
then she will not be anyone else’s. Shaheer. Listen to me, Shaheer. Oh God, what is he saying?
 I don’t understand. God damn it. I used to say no to it, 
but only if someone in this home would listen to me, then. Now see, Hamid Ali,
now you will know that the niece is bringing her proposal herself, after having an affair. You know, thank God, you cared a little for your uncle’s respect or else 
if you would have run away from this home, then what would we have been able to do to you?
 Huh? Listen to me. Tell me honestly, if we say no to your proposal, then will you run away from this home? Have you made a plan? Aunt, why would I do that? I didn’t even know that 
those people are coming with a proposal. Okay, stop this dramas in front of me. You don’t look good to me right now. And God damn it, there was no shame, 
you didn’t have a little shame following your mother’s footsteps. Shame. Shame. You know, 
blood shows its colours. No matter how you bring them up, 
it makes no difference. Wait, Shaheer. Don’t stop me, grandma. Let me meet her, or else I will not be able to tolerate th
 insult of rejection. Sabira, you leave. Sure. What is the need to go to their home 
and create a scene right now? Wait for the morning. I will not be able to tolerate it grandma. After all, how can she say no to me? Who told you that she said no? Her cousin called, she told me. What cousin? Tell me, what is the matter? What do I tell you grandma? What did she think before rejecting the proposal? 
What do I lack? You lack nothing. But no girl will say yes like that. First you win her heart, make her realize your liking in her heart. You saw her at a couple of places
and sent a proposal. Then why did she say that 
rich people are flirtatious? Every girl has some reservations in her heart, that is why she too is thinking these things. You win her heart. 
Take her out for dinner. Send her flowers. So that she doesn’t say no. Why didn’t I think of this earlier? How did I forget grandma, that girl doesn’t say 
yes to marrying without knowing and trying. I hope now you 
will have no complaints from Irha now. You know you didn’t tell me
 how long you know Shaheer Ahmad for? You didn’t even let me get a hint that
 you people have a scene. Sajjal, please. Now I will not prove my innocence. So, please. There is no room for goodness in this world. 
I had brought food for you. The thought came to my mind, 
so I asked you. So I am not hungry. Shaheer Ahmad is so cunning that you forget all your hunger and thirst. By the way you didn’t tell me, 
how did you meet him? Meet him? My insurance company insured his company,
that is it. This means you know him 
before Rehma’s marriage. You are absolutely wrong. I didn’t know Shaheer before that. I only heard his name, meeting him is out of the question. Really? After such a short meeting, 
he sent a proposal to your home? I am surprised. I don’t know what he saw in you. Anyway, I brought food for you. I have to go sleep, 
I have university tomorrow. I don’t have such luck that 
we get such great proposals. What was the need to say this nonsense? Shut up for a change. Yes, 
so when did I say something wrong? I knew already what this girl is up to with
 this excuse of her job. And now see, that happened. And if you are shameless with
the hopes to take away her wealth, then that is a different story. Irha didn’t make me bow down 
my head. If that boy desired Irha, 
then he has sent across a proposal in a respectable manner. Yes. The proposal that came is 
because your niece asked him to send it. Believe it Hamid Ali. This is a combined plan of the two 
and this girl is fooling us. Hey, all this will happen, what will we say to the family? Who is the family to question us? At least, I will not let you 
get insulted like this in the love of your niece. Hey, we too have some respect,
 how can we ruin it like this? What will you do? Say no to this proposal. 
This marriage cannot take place at any cost. Did I ask for your opinion? And this poison you have, 
keep it inside you. I will decide what needs to be done. Do you understand? No need to drive me mad. You will go mad when you 
will have to answer the world. You shut your mouth. I will deal with the world. I will give all the answers. I divorce you. He did the right thing. 
Aunt, I have done the work at home, 
I have also cooked the food and kneaded the flour. Now I am going for the office. This thing you have done 
with the office as an excuse, don’t be mistaken that we are so shameless that 
we will stay quiet because of your earning. After all, what can we say when
 our own coin is worthless. I always used to say this blood shows its colour. 
Now see, it showed its colour. I am getting late for office,
 I will leave. Goodbye. Now don’t insult us further, 
using the office as an excuse. After all, 
because of you we are unable to face anyone. You will be doing us a favour. Irha, where are you going? What is this? What if papa says yes for Irha’s proposal? She will get such a great proposal sitting around. How will he say yes without
 my permission? I will make life hell
 for both this uncle and niece. Let’s see, mama. You know papa doesn’t even listen 
to you in the matter of Irha. What if he says yes to this proposal 
because of your stubbornness? No matter what, I will not let this proposal get fixed. Mama, don’t you feel that such a good and 
rich man should have been your son in law? That’s the thing. Thinking about this
 my heart is burning into ashes. You know, this Irha she has great luck. But anyway, you don’t know your mother. I will make such a move that
 this proposal will not get finalized. So, this means that 
you don’t have an issue with a love marriage, you have an issue as to why the
 marriage is happening in such a rich home. Why are you asking me all this? Are you going to go to tell all this to your father? 
Do I seem that way to you? Child, I see a lot of things. Right now, 
if you took a day off from university, then do some work at home. Mama, I got just one day off, you will ruin it too.
 I don’t want to do any work. Excuse me. Tell Shaheer Ahmad, 
that Hira Murad Ali wants to meet her. Yes, sure. You wait, I will inform him. Excuse me? Madam. Where is his office? Miss, you cannot go like this. Where is it? Excuse me, 
you cannot go inside the office like this. Madam, please listen to me. What do you think of yourself Mr. Shaheer? Sorry sir. What were you thinking and who did you 
ask before sending a proposal to my home? Do you know me? Do you have any idea about me 
or my life? Miss Irha, please sit down. 
I didn’t come here to sit. I came to tell you that 
there is already enough difficulty in my life, you please don’t increase it further. I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. Nor do I have an idea about your difficulties. But I have wished for 
you with an honest heart. Your wish has insulted me. Questions are being asked on 
my character. Now who all do I give proof of 
my innocence? So Please. Please, for God’s sake, stay away from me.
 I will be thankful to you. Mr. Siddiqui, you. Okay, so you work here. No, I came for a meeting here. You have closed that case, right? Yes, that was done back then when 
Mr. Shaheer asked us. Did he not tell you? No. Actually, the day you came, 
even Mr. Shaheer came. We took the case back when he asked us to.
 In fact, we have been really lenient to you because of him. He also paid the fine. Okay, I have a meeting with him, I will leave. Thank you. What did I do? Greetings, 
Mr. Siddiqui, how are you? Greetings. 
I have a meeting with Mr. Shaheer. Yes, absolutely. Have a seat, 
I will inform sir. Mr. Hamid Ali, I only came to bother you again that 
you don’t make any decision without thinking. You surely do your checks about Shaheer. Madam, you are embarrassing me. You are great people and this achievement is enough for us that a proposal came for our daughter from your home. I by no means want
 to create differences in your home. But I have got news that 
maybe your family has some objection. They have some reservations towards Shaheer. This is a some school degrees, and office and university records of 
Mr. Shaheer. This also has some cards. If you want, you can call them and be satisfied. Madam, why are you embarrassing me,
 this is not needed. Believe me Shaheer has made such a big wish
 in his life for the first time in his life. He just wants to marry a girl who can take care of the home,
 and also walk next to him. This is the only reason 
she selected Irha in so many girls. You please don’t snatch away 
this desire of my son. Hey, no, no, madam. Don’t do that. Look madam, every father desires that 
his daughter goes to her in-laws and live a happy and fulfilled life. 
She lives happily. And this is enough comfort for me that 
she is going to the home of people like you. You just don’t worry. 
Whatever I wanted to know about you people, I have found out. Believe me, Irha will get married to son Shaheer. Are you speaking the truth? Thank you so much. 
You have fulfilled my heart’s desire. This is absolutely true, madam. But, I am really embarrassed in front of you because of the behaviour of my family and their cheap actions. But believe me madam, this will not happen again. 
I will try my best. Look, I didn’t mean to mislead you. I just wanted that 
you say yes for this proposal. Look you are a sober and good family. For us it is an achievement that our daughter is going to your home and there is nothing that 
can make me happier than this. Madam, if you find it suitable, then come to our home some time. I will really like it. I cannot forget this favour of yours all my life. Thank you very much for keeping my word. Madam, no need to thank me. You too have kept our word. I just pray to my God that these two just live happily and fulfilled. 
May they always live happy. Amen. Yes. Yes, Sajjal. How are you? I am fine. But I think your stars are spinning. What do you want to say? Say it clearly. A big fight happened in the home today. Papa was so angry, and so was Irha. Now even mama is against it too. Not maybe, but definitely,
 this proposal is impossible. It would be better that 
you find a good girl for you, someone who would care for you. Where would I get a good and pretty girl? The world is filled with good 
and beautiful girls. Irha is nothing in front of them. I don’t know what you saw in Irha. You look at her once and 
you wouldn’t want to look at her again. What are you saying, Sajjal? Why do I feel that 
you are jealous of Irha? Why would I be jealous? There is no comparison with her. There should be no comparison. You two are poles apart. As pretty you are, 
you fall in love with nature. But what do I do about this heart, Sajjal, that only desires for Irha. Someone is on the door. I will talk to you later. I will keep you posted. Goodbye. Greetings. Greetings. Shaheer. Grandma. You? Here? Why? I came to feed you sweets. Congratulations. Irha’s uncle has said yes
 to your marriage with Irha. Are you telling the truth? Grandma, don’t joke. 
You know I don’t like such jokes. I am coming from there right now. Why would I joke with you? Okay, you had sweets, not go and feed sweets to Irha too. Yes, but how did all this happen? You give this to me. Come here. Tell me. Tell me everything from the start. That how did all this happen. A to Z. If a woman like you would be in this home,
 then there can never be peace. I had told you…Papa. But, you? But you didn’t stop your cheapness. You have cheapness in your nature. Leave me, Papa, leave her. Leave me.
What are you saying? Today, I will kill her so that I stop getting insulted daily. What happened? 
What is mama’s fault, papa? What did I do? What did that poor thing do you? why are you jealous of her? What has she done? Speak up. Hey, what did I do? You? How did you say no 
to Shaheer Ahmad’s proposal? Who are you to say no to his proposal? No. No. No. You called him. No. Make me swear. I swear to God, I didn’t do anything. 
I don’t even have his number, why would I call? Shut your mouth. You are a liar. And hear something out clearly, now Irha’s wedding will only be done 
with Shaheer Ahmad. She will not get married anywhere else. And if you don’t like this, then you can leave this home and go. Papa, what are you saying? Papa. Oh God. Papa has said yes for the proposal. Mama. Mama, are you fine? Huh? Actually, the day you came,
 even Mr. Shaheer came. We took the case back when he asked us to.
 In fact, we have been really lenient to you because of him. He also paid the fine. Technically, I should be the one mourning 
my wedding being cancelled but you are here with a long face. What happened? Is everything fine? Buddy, there is a little work load,
that’s why. I am happy to see you, you faced the situation and 
also joined the office immediately. Irha, if I didn’t fight the situation, then maybe 
my parents would never have been able to stay strong. Mama was unable to get out of the guilt that 
how she selected a wrong person for me. But my heart says that 
God will send such a boy for you, who will always care for you. I don’t know about that, but maybe I don’t know 
if my heart will agree on trusting anyone or not. Anyway, the lunch time is over,
 should we go to have coffee? Buddy, I don’t feel like it, you go. Okay, I will bring your coffee here. Okay You recognize me by my scent, but you cannot feel the love hidden in my heart. Why? You? This is my office, so please. So? Should I be scared? I didn’t mean that, 
but I don’t want to create a scene here. So come with me, right now. Where? Where I can sit 
and answer all your questions. No, no, I don’t want any answers from you. You cannot be so unjust with me. You will have to give me a chance. I will make sure I get it. But… I am waiting for you in the car. I will not kidnap you. Don’t worry. I am not that bad a man. I am sorry. I said too much. No point in repeating the past, when we have a thousand things
 to discuss about the future. What riddles…Shush. Come with me. Mama, listen to me. I didn’t do anything. 
What do I listen to? What did you not do? I know everything. You did all this. You did it. Today, because of you, 
your father insulted me so much. I had told you, be a little patient. But no, 
you get restless till you get the thing you like. I swear to God, mama. I didn’t call him. It is possible that 
Shaheer Ahmad’s grandmother, instigated Shaheer Ahmad. No, if there was something like that, 
he wouldn’t have come so fearlessly to your father. He surely has a proof. So Shaheer Ahmad 
must have told him his name or not? Yes. Even if he doesn’t tell his name, then I still know who did this all. Mama. Okay… don’t say anything to papa, let it all go. 
Let it be. How can I let it go? You will see, the scene will be created now, like your father has created a scene out of me. Mama. My beloved mama, 
leave it for my sake. I am with you. Why should I let it go? And what does your father think? That I have no one? I have no one to care for me that he was threatening to kill me like this? You will see. I will show him right now. Mama. Mama, what is wrong? 
Mama, leave it. Mama. Mama, what are you doing? Mama, what are you doing? Leave it. Leave it. Relax. Your aunt won’t come here. You didn’t tell me, still, 
why did you bring me here? And what did you talk to uncle about? I have put your copyrights in my name. Now no power in the 
world can separate you from me. Not even you. What? Shaheer Ahmad turned out to be so cunning. I will not leave him now. Once he answer my call. Tell me, what did uncle say to you? Not me, grandma went. Eastern boys don’t look good
 talking about their own marriage. Shaheer, I am serious. Even I am serious
 to add Irha Murad Ali to my life. Look, it doesn’t matter what
 the world says about you or your mother. My heart made a wish to choose you 
as a life partner, and I promise that 
I will love this relation with my whole heart. Your uncle believes this, just this cruel girl needs to believe. So uncle said yes? Yes. Now please you don’t say no. I have been going around with 
this in my pocket for a lot of days, that the day you say yes, 
I will put it on your finger. Even I laugh at my madness, but what can I do, ever since I saw you, I have gone mad. Shaheer, whatever I said to you, I don’t want to say all that. Just think that I was a little helpless. But now if uncle has said yes, then there is no reason for me to say no. This means your heart 
still didn’t melt on my love. No problem. I will make you believe in my love as well. May I?
