[18.56] I know being the father of a girl,
[21.48] it is not possible to respond quickly.
[25.68] But still give me some hope so that 
we are not disappointed
[31.84] and we can spend the tough time of the wait.
[39.16] What will Hamid Ali say?
[44.44] Your wish has surprised him.
[50.36] You tell me,
[52.32] are you giving us an order 
or are you asking for a proposal?
[55.68] I don’t understand
[57.68] Look,
[59.68] in our families,
 girls don’t get married by their liking.
[66.60] And if proposals come like this,
[68.80] they are not encouraged.
[76.16] This shamelessness must be
 common in affluent families like yours,
[79.40] we are decent people.
[85.40] You be quiet, Noshaba.
[86.44] Why should I be quiet?
[88.16] When the matter comes to your niece, 
you will break all your rules?
[92.80] If my daughter had done this,
[95.36] you would never have said yes.
[97.56] I told you to be quiet, Noshaba.
[99.88] This is the reason 
I used to tell you to be careful.
[104.08] If something wrong happens in future,
[105.68] we will not be able to face anyone.
[108.20] But you.
[109.64] You never listened to me.
[114.56] These affluent people 
get married in our homes happily,
[119.88] but when they get done,
[122.60] they leave you midway.
[125.56] What are you trying to say?
 I don’t understand?
[128.76] We are respectable people,
 why would we do this?
[131.68] Respectable people?
[134.00] The stories of respectable people 
partying are not hidden from us.
[139.88] Look,
[141.00] we are simple and decent people,
[143.60] and for God’s sake, have mercy on us.
[146.20] She is a child without parents,
[148.04] and if something happens in future,
[149.52] then we will be at risk on judgement day.
[152.56] Noshaba, be quiet.
[155.60] Go from here.
[157.28] Noshaba, I am telling you, 
leave from here.
[176.60] Madam,
[178.52] I am really embarrassed,
[181.80] my wife is really ill-mannered.
[184.72] I apologize on her behalf.
[188.40] Forgive us.
[189.76] No problem, Mr. Hamid Ali,
[192.16] I didn’t mind it at all.
[194.24] Because she doesn’t know me.
[196.32] But you don’t do this.
[198.64] I will wait for your yes.
[201.44] Live long, child.
[202.80] Take care.
[205.88] I will leave now.
[225.64] I knew it before hand that 
this girl will do something like this. See,
[229.88] the grandness she has got her hands on.
[231.32] She is following her mother’s footsteps.
[234.36] My heart is burning to ashes.
[237.00] How can Shaheer Ahmad 
send her proposal like this?
[239.80] What did he see in her? 
How did he like her?
[242.72] She knows the art of talking.
[244.56] She makes people her fan.
[246.08] She must have made him
 crazy after her.
[248.48] Mama, is there a misunderstanding?
[251.08] What are you saying? 
What misunderstanding?
[253.96] That grandmother,
[255.12] she has even made her, 
her fan.
[257.56] Can you stop this proposal somehow?
[259.96] Do anything and say no to this proposal. 
Please mama, for my sake.
[263.04] Hey, I have tried a lot, 
but your father insulted me and sent me away.
[266.76] Did he say yes?
[268.56] Did you see your aunt’s adventure
[272.64] and you still want that 
I don’t marry you?
[280.60] Child,
[283.04] now it is necessary for you to get married.
[289.68] Shaheer Ahmad 
has expressed his liking with a lot of love.
[300.28] Think hard and decide.
[303.08] What if he likes some other 
girl tomorrow and he….
[309.52] You believe me uncle?
[313.76] More than myself.
[315.64] Then believe me,
[318.44] I didn’t encourage Shaheer Ahmad 
even a little in the matter of marriage.
[323.08] I didn’t even know
 those people would send a proposal.
[329.04] I know child.
[331.80] That is why I am saying,
[333.60] whatever you decide, think hard.
[339.52] What if we have to regret later.
[346.80] So I have made my decision.
[350.12] I will get married by your will,
[353.16] you say no to Shaheer Ahmad.
[356.60] I do not accept Shaheer Ahmad’s proposal.
[358.88] You say no to them.
[381.92] Yes, grandma. Tell me quickly, 
what did Irha say?
[385.80] You were really waiting restlessly.
[389.40] Oh sorry, I didn’t see the number.
[393.24] I am the one who should say sorry,
Shaheer Ahmad.
[396.48] You sent a proposal without thinking.
[399.76] Without knowing 
if she is interested in you or not.
[403.36] I don’t understand. 
What do you want to say?
[406.24] For your betterment, 
I want to tell you that me and Irha are cousins
[410.52] and we live in the same home.
[413.60] And where you are together since childhood,
[415.76] you cannot hide anything even
if you want to.
[419.08] Sajjal, talk clearly,
[420.72] why are you talking in riddles?
[423.88] Irha has said no to the proposal.
[433.00] What?
[435.96] How is this possible?
[438.60] Nothing is impossible for a girl like Irha.
[441.60] She has a habit of giving surprises.
[445.16] There must be a reason for the refusal.
[447.24] Do I lack something…
I asked her the same thing, and so did mama.
[451.76] She is just insisting on one thing that 
she doesn’t want to marry a flirt like you.
[457.48] And even papa agreed to her.
[460.52] He also says the same thing,
 that people like you, rich people,
[464.40] they are flirtatious.
[466.64] What?
[468.56] Is Irha out of her mind?
[470.44] Her fate is bad.
[472.28] Or else can someone say no 
to a person like you?
[476.20] By the way you don’t lack girls.
[479.12] If you run after girls like Irha then
 they will show tantrums.
[489.04] Maybe you are right.
[503.88] We will have fun now.
[506.16] Now Shaheer Ahmad will find out the result 
of rejecting a beautiful girl like me
[511.32] and opting for an average girl like Irha.
[561.68] What did Irha’s family say?
[563.80] What will they tell us this early, 
child?
[566.40] They have asked for some time and
 they are not wrong either.
[569.12] A marriage is not a game,
[571.36] that they agree immediately.
[573.00] Why are you hiding it from me,
 grandma?
[574.64] Tell me the truth, 
that they have said no to your grandson.
[577.24] Who told you?
[578.72] What do you think? If you hide it from me, 
I will not find out?
[582.04] Why would I hide it from you?
[586.08] I don’t know what you are saying, 
I don’t understand.
[589.08] They will have to pay a high price for this refusal.
[592.40] If Irha is not mine, 
then she will not be anyone else’s.
[595.00] Shaheer. Listen to me, Shaheer.
[598.24] Oh God, what is he saying?
 I don’t understand.
[602.12] God damn it.
[603.68] I used to say no to it, 
but only if someone in this home would listen to me, then.
[608.28] Now see, Hamid Ali,
now you will know that
[610.96] the niece is bringing her proposal herself,
[614.08] after having an affair.
[616.76] You know, thank God,
[618.24] you cared a little for your uncle’s respect
[620.96] or else 
if you would have run away from this home,
[623.28] then what would we have been able to do to you?
 Huh?
[627.08] Listen to me.
[628.96] Tell me honestly,
[630.76] if we say no to your proposal,
[633.04] then will you run away from this home?
[634.64] Have you made a plan?
[636.24] Aunt, why would I do that?
[638.12] I didn’t even know that 
those people are coming with a proposal.
[641.12] Okay, stop this dramas in front of me.
[644.48] You don’t look good to me right now.
[646.80] And God damn it,
[648.20] there was no shame, 
you didn’t have a little shame following your mother’s footsteps.
[653.20] Shame. Shame. You know, 
blood shows its colours.
[655.88] No matter how you bring them up, 
it makes no difference.
[680.96] Wait, Shaheer.
[683.84] Don’t stop me, grandma.
[685.28] Let me meet her,
[686.84] or else I will not be able to tolerate th
 insult of rejection.
[689.48] Sabira, you leave.
[690.80] Sure.
[694.84] What is the need to go to their home 
and create a scene right now?
[697.96] Wait for the morning.
[699.76] I will not be able to tolerate it grandma.
[702.04] After all, how can she say no to me?
[707.96] Who told you that she said no?
[711.44] Her cousin called, she told me.
[714.36] What cousin?
[715.52] Tell me, what is the matter?
[717.56] What do I tell you grandma?
[719.32] What did she think before rejecting the proposal? 
What do I lack?
[722.40] You lack nothing.
[724.40] But no girl will say yes like that.
[727.16] First you win her heart,
[729.12] make her realize your liking in her heart.
[731.96] You saw her at a couple of places
and sent a proposal.
[735.52] Then why did she say that 
rich people are flirtatious?
[738.32] Every girl has some reservations in her heart,
[741.44] that is why she too is thinking these things.
[744.12] You win her heart. 
Take her out for dinner.
[747.56] Send her flowers.
[749.44] So that she doesn’t say no.
[756.36] Why didn’t I think of this earlier?
[762.92] How did I forget grandma,
[764.96] that girl doesn’t say 
yes to marrying without knowing and trying.
[770.80] I hope now you 
will have no complaints from Irha now.
[808.08] You know you didn’t tell me
 how long you know Shaheer Ahmad for?
[811.88] You didn’t even let me get a hint that
 you people have a scene.
[815.64] Sajjal, please.
[817.76] Now I will not prove my innocence.
[821.24] So, please.
[823.36] There is no room for goodness in this world. 
I had brought food for you.
[826.64] The thought came to my mind, 
so I asked you.
[828.08] So I am not hungry.
[831.20] Shaheer Ahmad is so cunning that
[833.08] you forget all your hunger and thirst.
[837.32] By the way you didn’t tell me, 
how did you meet him?
[841.80] Meet him?
[844.00] My insurance company insured his company,
that is it.
[850.12] This means you know him 
before Rehma’s marriage.
[854.56] You are absolutely wrong.
[857.20] I didn’t know Shaheer before that.
[861.24] I only heard his name,
[863.00] meeting him is out of the question.
[865.04] Really?
[866.64] After such a short meeting, 
he sent a proposal to your home?
[871.04] I am surprised.
[872.40] I don’t know what he saw in you.
[874.68] Anyway, I brought food for you.
[876.80] I have to go sleep, 
I have university tomorrow.
[879.36] I don’t have such luck that 
we get such great proposals.
[895.24] What was the need to say this nonsense?
[898.00] Shut up for a change.
[900.32] Yes, 
so when did I say something wrong?
[903.20] I knew already what this girl is up to with
 this excuse of her job.
[908.96] And now see, that happened.
[910.96] And if you are shameless with
the hopes to take away her wealth,
[915.92] then that is a different story.
[917.20] Irha didn’t make me bow down 
my head.
[919.56] If that boy desired Irha, 
then he has sent across a proposal in a respectable manner.
[924.84] Yes.
[925.92] The proposal that came is 
because your niece asked him to send it.
[929.76] Believe it Hamid Ali.
[931.00] This is a combined plan of the two 
and this girl is fooling us.
[935.20] Hey, all this will happen,
[936.92] what will we say to the family?
[938.68] Who is the family to question us?
[941.76] At least, I will not let you 
get insulted like this in the love of your niece.
[946.44] Hey, we too have some respect,
 how can we ruin it like this?
[951.00] What will you do?
[952.92] Say no to this proposal. 
This marriage cannot take place at any cost.
[956.00] Did I ask for your opinion?
[958.04] And this poison you have, 
keep it inside you.
[962.52] I will decide what needs to be done.
[964.80] Do you understand?
[966.04] No need to drive me mad.
[968.36] You will go mad when you 
will have to answer the world.
[971.84] You shut your mouth.
[974.00] I will deal with the world.
[976.08] I will give all the answers.
[992.44] I divorce you. He did the right thing. 
Aunt,
[995.20] I have done the work at home, 
I have also cooked the food and kneaded the flour.
[1001.24] Now I am going for the office.
[1003.04] This thing you have done 
with the office as an excuse,
[1006.44] don’t be mistaken that
[1008.20] we are so shameless that 
we will stay quiet because of your earning.
[1012.76] After all,
[1014.24] what can we say when
 our own coin is worthless.
[1017.36] I always used to say this blood shows its colour. 
Now see,
[1022.28] it showed its colour.
[1024.76] I am getting late for office,
 I will leave. Goodbye.
[1028.08] Now don’t insult us further, 
using the office as an excuse.
[1032.36] After all, 
because of you we are unable to face anyone.
[1036.20] You will be doing us a favour.
[1097.48] Irha, where are you going?
[1101.60] What is this?
[1107.40] What if papa says yes for Irha’s proposal?
[1111.32] She will get such a great proposal sitting around.
[1114.52] How will he say yes without
 my permission?
[1117.20] I will make life hell
 for both this uncle and niece.
[1120.96] Let’s see, mama.
[1122.28] You know papa doesn’t even listen 
to you in the matter of Irha.
[1125.04] What if he says yes to this proposal 
because of your stubbornness?
[1129.04] No matter what,
[1130.96] I will not let this proposal get fixed.
[1134.76] Mama,
[1136.32] don’t you feel that such a good and 
rich man should have been your son in law?
[1141.68] That’s the thing.
[1143.24] Thinking about this
 my heart is burning into ashes.
[1147.44] You know, this Irha she has great luck.
[1151.12] But anyway,
[1152.52] you don’t know your mother.
[1154.84] I will make such a move that
 this proposal will not get finalized.
[1159.40] So, this means that 
you don’t have an issue with a love marriage,
[1164.00] you have an issue as to why the
 marriage is happening in such a rich home.
[1167.96] Why are you asking me all this?
[1170.32] Are you going to go to tell all this to your father? 
Do I seem that way to you?
[1174.60] Child, I see a lot of things.
[1176.80] Right now, 
if you took a day off from university,
[1179.20] then do some work at home.
[1181.56] Mama, I got just one day off, you will ruin it too.
 I don’t want to do any work.
[1199.64] Excuse me.
[1200.72] Tell Shaheer Ahmad, 
that Hira Murad Ali wants to meet her.
[1203.32] Yes, sure. You wait, I will inform him.
[1208.16] Excuse me? Madam.
[1210.76] Where is his office?
[1211.88] Miss, you cannot go like this.
[1215.64] Where is it? Excuse me, 
you cannot go inside the office like this. Madam, please listen to me.
[1220.36] What do you think of yourself Mr. Shaheer?
[1222.20] Sorry sir.
[1222.92] What were you thinking and who did you 
ask before sending a proposal to my home?
[1225.80] Do you know me?
[1227.16] Do you have any idea about me 
or my life?
[1231.44] Miss Irha, please sit down. 
I didn’t come here to sit.
[1234.12] I came to tell you that 
there is already enough difficulty in my life,
[1237.68] you please don’t increase it further.
[1241.44] I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you.
[1244.84] Nor do I have an idea about your difficulties.
[1247.40] But I have wished for 
you with an honest heart.
[1248.68] Your wish has insulted me.
[1251.32] Questions are being asked on 
my character.
[1253.36] Now who all do I give proof of 
my innocence?
[1255.88] So Please.
[1257.20] Please, for God’s sake, stay away from me.
 I will be thankful to you.
[1283.44] Mr. Siddiqui, you.
[1286.64] Okay, so you work here.
[1290.36] No, I came for a meeting here.
[1293.20] You have closed that case, right?
[1295.20] Yes, that was done back then when 
Mr. Shaheer asked us.
[1299.24] Did he not tell you?
[1301.96] No.
[1303.84] Actually, the day you came, 
even Mr. Shaheer came.
[1307.72] We took the case back when he asked us to.
 In fact, we have been really lenient to you because of him.
[1313.04] He also paid the fine.
[1317.20] Okay, I have a meeting with him,
[1320.72] I will leave. Thank you.
[1325.72] What did I do? Greetings, 
Mr. Siddiqui, how are you?
[1328.36] Greetings. 
I have a meeting with Mr. Shaheer.
[1331.56] Yes, absolutely. Have a seat, 
I will inform sir.
[1336.20] Mr. Hamid Ali,
[1337.60] I only came to bother you again that 
you don’t make any decision without thinking.
[1344.84] You surely do your checks about Shaheer.
[1348.88] Madam, you are embarrassing me.
[1353.32] You are great people
[1355.36] and this achievement is enough for us that
[1358.08] a proposal came for our daughter from your home.
[1361.84] I by no means want
 to create differences in your home.
[1366.24] But I have got news that 
maybe your family has some objection.
[1370.52] They have some reservations towards Shaheer.
[1377.44] This is a some school degrees,
[1381.52] and office and university records of 
Mr. Shaheer.
[1384.92] This also has some cards.
[1387.40] If you want,
[1388.92] you can call them and be satisfied.
[1392.48] Madam, why are you embarrassing me,
 this is not needed.
[1396.72] Believe me
[1401.12] Shaheer has made such a big wish
 in his life for the first time in his life.
[1407.84] He just wants to marry a girl who can take care of the home,
 and also walk next to him.
[1416.28] This is the only reason 
she selected Irha in so many girls.
[1420.48] You please don’t snatch away 
this desire of my son.
[1424.00] Hey, no, no, madam. Don’t do that.
[1428.72] Look madam,
[1430.52] every father desires that 
his daughter goes to her in-laws
[1435.92] and live a happy and fulfilled life. 
She lives happily.
[1439.84] And this is enough comfort for me that 
she is going to the home of people like you.
[1447.28] You just don’t worry. 
Whatever I wanted to know about you people, I have found out.
[1455.04] Believe me,
[1456.96] Irha will get married to son Shaheer.
[1460.96] Are you speaking the truth?
[1463.12] Thank you so much. 
You have fulfilled my heart’s desire.
[1466.40] This is absolutely true, madam.
[1469.88] But,
[1472.56] I am really embarrassed in front of you
[1475.88] because of the behaviour of my family
[1478.52] and their cheap actions.
[1480.72] But believe me madam,
[1482.92] this will not happen again. 
I will try my best.
[1486.36] Look, I didn’t mean to mislead you.
[1489.80] I just wanted that 
you say yes for this proposal.
[1495.56] Look you are a sober and good family.
[1500.04] For us it is an achievement that
[1502.80] our daughter is going to your home
[1507.12] and there is nothing that 
can make me happier than this.
[1510.76] Madam, if you find it suitable,
[1514.28] then come to our home some time.
[1516.40] I will really like it.
[1518.36] I cannot forget this favour of yours all my life.
[1522.36] Thank you very much for keeping my word.
[1525.48] Madam,
[1527.00] no need to thank me.
[1528.92] You too have kept our word.
[1531.80] I just pray to my God that
[1535.68] these two just live happily and fulfilled. 
May they always live happy.
[1540.76] Amen. Yes.
[1551.36] Yes, Sajjal. How are you?
[1554.40] I am fine.
[1556.04] But I think your stars are spinning.
[1559.60] What do you want to say?
[1560.76] Say it clearly.
[1562.04] A big fight happened in the home today.
[1564.64] Papa was so angry, and so was Irha.
[1567.32] Now even mama is against it too.
[1569.72] Not maybe, but definitely,
 this proposal is impossible.
[1575.28] It would be better that 
you find a good girl for you,
[1578.84] someone who would care for you.
[1582.76] Where would I get a good and pretty girl?
[1586.96] The world is filled with good 
and beautiful girls.
[1591.40] Irha is nothing in front of them.
[1594.44] I don’t know what you saw in Irha.
[1596.24] You look at her once and 
you wouldn’t want to look at her again.
[1599.48] What are you saying, Sajjal?
[1602.12] Why do I feel that 
you are jealous of Irha?
[1604.84] Why would I be jealous?
[1607.04] There is no comparison with her.
[1609.60] There should be no comparison.
[1611.48] You two are poles apart.
[1614.48] As pretty you are, 
you fall in love with nature.
[1620.96] But what do I do about this heart, Sajjal,
[1623.36] that only desires for Irha.
[1627.32] Someone is on the door.
[1629.52] I will talk to you later.
[1631.56] I will keep you posted.
[1634.04] Goodbye.
[1656.00] Greetings.
[1656.76] Greetings.
[1667.72] Shaheer.
[1670.24] Grandma. You? Here? Why?
[1673.68] I came to feed you sweets.
[1678.80] Congratulations.
[1680.96] Irha’s uncle has said yes
 to your marriage with Irha.
[1686.80] Are you telling the truth?
[1688.96] Grandma, don’t joke. 
You know I don’t like such jokes.
[1693.44] I am coming from there right now.
[1695.80] Why would I joke with you?
[1698.24] Okay, you had sweets,
[1700.76] not go and feed sweets to Irha too.
[1702.76] Yes, but how did all this happen?
[1704.40] You give this to me. Come here.
[1706.44] Tell me. Tell me everything from the start.
[1708.96] That how did all this happen. A to Z.
[1715.68] If a woman like you would be in this home,
 then there can never be peace.
[1720.40] I had told you…Papa.
[1722.56] But, you?
[1723.80] But you didn’t stop your cheapness.
[1725.36] You have cheapness in your nature.
[1728.44] Leave me, Papa, leave her. Leave me.
What are you saying?
[1731.52] Today, I will kill her so that
[1733.68] I stop getting insulted daily.
[1737.00] What happened? 
What is mama’s fault, papa?
[1739.76] What did I do?
[1741.20] What did that poor thing do you?
[1743.20] why are you jealous of her?
[1744.60] What has she done?
[1747.04] Speak up.
[1747.84] Hey, what did I do? You?
[1750.40] How did you say no 
to Shaheer Ahmad’s proposal?
[1753.28] Who are you to say no to his proposal?
[1756.08] No. No. No. You called him.
[1757.92] No. Make me swear. I swear to God,
[1759.32] I didn’t do anything. 
I don’t even have his number, why would I call?
[1762.72] Shut your mouth. You are a liar.
[1765.16] And hear something out clearly,
[1767.60] now Irha’s wedding will only be done 
with Shaheer Ahmad.
[1773.20] She will not get married anywhere else.
[1775.96] And if you don’t like this,
[1778.68] then you can leave this home and go.
[1781.16] Papa, what are you saying? Papa.
[1786.28] Oh God.
[1789.28] Papa has said yes for the proposal.
[1794.00] Mama.
[1795.24] Mama, are you fine?
[1798.40] Huh?
[1804.68] Actually, the day you came,
 even Mr. Shaheer came.
[1808.72] We took the case back when he asked us to.
 In fact, we have been really lenient to you because of him.
[1814.20] He also paid the fine.
[1821.04] Technically, I should be the one mourning 
my wedding being cancelled
[1824.32] but you are here with a long face.
[1826.92] What happened? Is everything fine?
[1828.96] Buddy, there is a little work load,
that’s why.
[1833.72] I am happy to see you,
[1837.28] you faced the situation and 
also joined the office immediately.
[1843.12] Irha, if I didn’t fight the situation, then maybe 
my parents would never have been able to stay strong.
[1848.76] Mama was unable to get out of the guilt that 
how she selected a wrong person for me.
[1856.52] But my heart says that 
God will send such a boy for you,
[1860.92] who will always care for you.
[1864.12] I don’t know about that, but maybe I don’t know 
if my heart will agree on trusting anyone or not.
[1871.24] Anyway, the lunch time is over,
 should we go to have coffee?
[1875.92] Buddy, I don’t feel like it, you go.
[1877.80] Okay, I will bring your coffee here.
[1879.96] Okay
[1898.20] You recognize me by my scent,
[1901.48] but you cannot feel the love hidden in my heart.
[1904.32] Why? You?
[1906.88] This is my office, so please.
[1909.24] So?
[1910.52] Should I be scared?
[1912.24] I didn’t mean that, 
but I don’t want to create a scene here.
[1916.32] So come with me, right now.
[1918.56] Where?
[1921.96] Where I can sit 
and answer all your questions.
[1925.16] No, no, I don’t want any answers from you.
[1928.44] You cannot be so unjust with me.
[1931.92] You will have to give me a chance.
[1934.72] I will make sure I get it.
[1937.52] But… I am waiting for you in the car.
[1963.52] I will not kidnap you.
[1965.28] Don’t worry.
[1966.48] I am not that bad a man.
[1972.28] I am sorry.
[1976.72] I said too much.
[1979.12] No point in repeating the past,
[1981.76] when we have a thousand things
 to discuss about the future.
[1985.68] What riddles…Shush.
[1989.64] Come with me.
[2021.64] Mama, listen to me.
[2023.28] I didn’t do anything. 
What do I listen to?
[2026.24] What did you not do?
[2027.40] I know everything.
[2028.96] You did all this. You did it.
[2032.20] Today, because of you, 
your father insulted me so much.
[2037.16] I had told you,
[2038.88] be a little patient. But no, 
you get restless till you get the thing you like.
[2044.20] I swear to God, mama. I didn’t call him.
[2047.56] It is possible that 
Shaheer Ahmad’s grandmother,
[2050.92] instigated Shaheer Ahmad. No,
[2053.28] if there was something like that, 
he wouldn’t have come so fearlessly to your father.
[2058.32] He surely has a proof.
[2060.92] So Shaheer Ahmad 
must have told him his name or not?
[2063.52] Yes. Even if he doesn’t tell his name,
[2066.76] then I still know who did this all.
[2071.80] Mama. Okay…
[2074.44] don’t say anything to papa, let it all go. 
Let it be. How can I let it go?
[2079.40] You will see,
[2080.56] the scene will be created now,
[2082.24] like your father has created a scene out of me.
[2085.72] Mama. My beloved mama, 
leave it for my sake.
[2089.44] I am with you.
[2091.52] Why should I let it go?
[2092.88] And what does your father think?
[2094.64] That I have no one?
[2096.44] I have no one to care for me that
[2098.24] he was threatening to kill me like this?
[2101.56] You will see.
[2104.28] I will show him right now.
[2105.88] Mama.
[2107.44] Mama, what is wrong? 
Mama, leave it. Mama.
[2110.28] Mama, what are you doing?
[2112.32] Mama, what are you doing? Leave it.
[2114.84] Leave it.
[2123.92] Relax.
[2126.00] Your aunt won’t come here.
[2129.00] You didn’t tell me, still, 
why did you bring me here?
[2132.88] And what did you talk to uncle about?
[2135.84] I have put your copyrights in my name.
[2138.68] Now no power in the 
world can separate you from me.
[2141.44] Not even you.
[2143.00] What?
[2159.04] Shaheer Ahmad turned out to be so cunning.
[2161.92] I will not leave him now.
[2164.76] Once he answer my call.
[2170.52] Tell me, what did uncle say to you?
[2173.24] Not me, grandma went.
[2175.68] Eastern boys don’t look good
 talking about their own marriage.
[2179.16] Shaheer, I am serious.
[2181.04] Even I am serious
 to add Irha Murad Ali to my life.
[2187.28] Look, it doesn’t matter what
 the world says about you or your mother.
[2192.60] My heart made a wish to choose you 
as a life partner,
[2196.36] and I promise that 
I will love this relation with my whole heart.
[2200.80] Your uncle believes this,
[2203.76] just this cruel girl needs to believe.
[2208.84] So uncle said yes?
[2210.60] Yes.
[2212.32] Now please you don’t say no.
[2221.96] I have been going around with 
this in my pocket for a lot of days,
[2224.40] that the day you say yes, 
I will put it on your finger.
[2229.44] Even I laugh at my madness,
[2231.80] but what can I do,
[2233.08] ever since I saw you, I have gone mad.
[2236.80] Shaheer,
[2238.16] whatever I said to you,
[2240.76] I don’t want to say all that.
[2244.16] Just think that I was a little helpless.
[2248.88] But now if uncle has said yes,
[2251.64] then there is no reason for me to say no.
[2255.24] This means your heart 
still didn’t melt on my love.
[2260.00] No problem.
[2261.84] I will make you believe in my love as well.
[2264.84] May I?
