My child, I know your sorrow is really big. Get a grip on yourself. Shaheer is really damned that 
he couldn’t care for you. I am not sad about this divorce, aunt. This had to happen one day. But Shaheer didn’t have a little 
mercy for a mother in his heart. He has become so cruel. Did you go to meet, Fatima? When my heart becomes really restless, when I am unable to control myself, 
then I secretly go to meet her. Okay, you don’t cry. You will see, everything will be fine. God will soften his heart, 
then no one can stop you from meeting your daughter. I don’t want anything from him, aunt. He should just let me meet Fatima, sometimes. Then I will gradually 
get in the habit of living without her. But right now, I am unable to control myself. I cannot live without meeting her, aunt. Okay, stop crying, child. Pray to God. Because we cannot have 
any hopes from humans. He is the only One who will listen to our prayer. You have faced so many sorrows in your life,
child. Another one. Everything will be fine. Just don’t cry. Good evening, sweetheart. What is the matter? Is everything okay? Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing. Did the deal get finalized? Well, the progress is good, it will get final. You didn’t tell me you
 are facing so much loss in business. There is up and down in business. Still, you should have told me, I am your business partner. If you hide things from me, how would I feel? I just don’t want to worry you. There is nothing else. What about Irha’s property? I have divorced her, that is why 
I am not taking back the property from her. Why? I am not in the habit to take something back 
from someone after I have given it. Don’t make a losing deal in this greatness of yours. I have heard that 
your markets are falling quickly in the market. If you are with me, then I don’t fear any loss. Just don’t let your love be reduced, I will stand against each storm in the world. You couldn’t even give me your name, what else can I expect from you? Once this deal is finalized, I promise you we will get married after this. Come on, cheer up. I have divorced her. You divorced her after so long. Sajjal. Hello. Where do I have to come? Sajjal. Sajjal. Greetings sir. Where is madam Sajjal? Madam Sajjal is not at home. Where did she go? She didn’t tell me before leaving, but she often goes out after you leave. Then who takes care of Fatima? I have madam Fatima with me. But sir, you don’t say anything to her, she will get upset. What do I ask her waking her up? Things will get out of hands for no reason. But Sajjal is becoming negligent towards Fatima. Staying out of the home for so long, leaving Fatima on the maid and going. How long has this been going on for? And how long will it go on for? I will have to talk to her. Oh wow. Shaheer, you did all this? This is nothing to welcome my daughter. You see what I do for her in the future. Such big surprises on your daughter’s arrival. My love…Fatima is so good, she is so pretty. 
Really pretty. She takes up after Shaheer. No. No. Her features are delicate like Irha. 
Yes? Oh God, give me patience and peace. The separation from 
my daughter makes me suffer, God. Give me peace and keep my daughter in your protection. We in our fight for relations, lose innocent children. At times, mother, at times, father. Fighting with each other, we torment our children. And those flowers that 
need to be brought up with love, start getting ignored in our hatred, they begin to wither. Oh God, you keep my daughter safe. May the heat of the differences between me 
and Shaheer never fall on her. Keep her in Your protection, God. We are not capable of facing Your challenges, we couldn’t even take care of the 
blessing You gave us. But You help me. Shaheer has gifted you
 a really valuable property. But it is not worth more 
than the time you gave him. I just have all this. Think that I am playing a gamble. God knows why I want to trust you. Why don’t you leave him? I will take you to the heights of success. You will have more money and wealth than this. How is this possible? Shaheer really loves me. He doesn’t love you. If he did, he would have married you till now. After all, he is a player, he wouldn’t want to be trapped by anyone. Well, leaving him or not leaving him is up to you. He is just waiting for the deal with you to happen, 
after that we will get married. Fine, I will believe you if you say so. But according to his past records, he is only passing his time with you, and you have already
 become his daughter’s governess. You don’t deserve this, Sajjal. But anyway, my business deal has nothing
 to do with his personal life. Rest, you are smart. I am getting late. I will leave. Sajjal, at times what you see is not the truth. I will take you to the heights of success. You will have more money and wealth than this. How is this possible? 
Shaheer really loves me. He doesn’t love you. If he did, he would have married you till now. After all, he is a player, he wouldn’t want to be trapped by anyone. Well, leaving him or not leaving him is up to you. He is just waiting for the deal with you to happen, after that we will get married. Fine, I will believe you if you say so. But according to his past records, he is only passing his time with you, and you have already 
become his daughter’s governess. You don’t deserve this, Sajjal. What Sultan is saying has weightage. The one who gifted me such a big diamond set 
on our first meeting, and Shaheer couldn’t give me anything 
other than consolation and hopes. I have become a joke. Or the governess of his daughter. You came back soon. Where are you coming from? I went to the mall. So dressed up? Did you go the mall yesterday too? What is there to be surprised in this? I get ready for you too every day. If you dress up for me, then have you 
found another Shaheer Ahmad in my absence? What do you mean? Do you have no shame that 
you are putting such a cheap allegation on me? I am asking. If it is not true, then deny it. But your anger tells me that maybe I am right. 
That maybe I am right. You know, what? You are disgusting. He is just waiting for the deal 
with you to happen, after that we will get married. Fine, I will believe you if you say so. But according to his past records, he is only passing his time with you, I am sorry, I said too much in my anger. Thank God your mourning 
days have passed safely. I even got a call from the office. They are asking me to join from tomorrow. That is good child. Go safely. May God bless you and what you earn. After all, child, when a person starts working, they forget a hundred sorrows. But aunt these sorrows are such that 
maybe I will not be able to forget all my life. At times, I feel that maybe there was something lacking in my faithfulness that Shaheer did all this with me. No Irha, you don’t lack anything, child. You are a courageous, strong and faithful girl. It is Shaheer who is unlucky, who didn’t know the worth of a diamond like you. Aunt, I don’t know if I am a diamond or not, or else he would not have put such a bad 
stain on me for the rest of my life. There is no stain on your life. The bad stain is my daughter Sajjal, who has ruined a happy and settled life. I will never forgive her. You are a mother. Forgive her like a mother. You forgive with your heart, and my heart is not clean towards Sajjal, child. You will see, child, one day Shaheer and Sajjal will regret. Right now they are blindfolded by the shimmer, the day this blindfold is removed from the eyes, that day they would feel each 
other’s existence for themselves as worthless. It will feel like dust. And I am waiting for that day. I am waiting for the day and you will also see that unfaithfulness is only met with unfaithfulness, 
child. But I have nothing left for my entire life, 
but patience. No, child, you have courage, the strength, you have the capability and your future is really bright, child. Your honesty and goodness will take you far. You will always be successful in life, child. My prayers are with you. Greetings sir, your breakfast is ready. Where is madam Fatima? I put madam to sleep with difficulty. Why? She had fever all night, I kept cold compress and the fever went down. 
Now she is sleeping. If she had such high fever,
 then why did you not tell me? Sir, we had told madam, she told us to give her medication and
 put her to sleep. She also told us not to tell you so that you don’t worry. She has lost her mind. If something like this happens again,
 tell me directly. Yes, sure. Right now she doesn’t have fever, Right now, she doesn’t have fever, I too will try to come back soon. But if there is any issue, 
then call me immediately. Sure, sir. Hello. Yes. I was sleeping. That’s great news. Okay, I will come over. Don’t worry. No one can stop me from 
becoming a business woman. Thank you so much, Sultan. Madam, Sajjal. Yes? Madam Fatima’s fever is really high. Oh, did you not give her medication at night? I gave her medication. 
The fever goes down and then increases. It is really necessary to take her to the doctor. Even sir said this and went. Yes, so what was your sir saying? Tell madam Sajjal to take madam Fatima 
to the doctor, I too will come early. Then why doesn’t your sir take his daughter? Is it all my responsibility. Madam, what should I do? I told you, take care of her. 
Put cold compress. The fever is really high, 
it is not even going down with cold compress. I told you, it is important for me to go. 
Manage it. I will take her when I come back. But this way sir will get further upset. So you don’t spy on me for sir. I will come back and fulfil my duty. This child has made my life hell. What happened? You don’t look fine. I don’t know why my heart is worried. Do you mind if I excuse myself from this presentation? No, you go home. This is the result of working day and night. Thank you, madam. The diamonds look beautiful on you. Thank you for wearing then. Thank you for giving me such beautiful 
and expensive diamonds. This is the start of our friendship and this is just an ordinary gift. I will be really happy once you
 become a successful businesswoman. We are business partners, right? Yes, definitely. And since your steps have joined mine, I have only had benefit. This is a positive sign. I have taken the right decision at the right time. Thank you to you. You are welcome. I have opened your bank account. This has your cards,
 and there is a cheque book as well. You don’t have to be dependent on anyone. You can do what you want, independently. I made the smartest decision of 
my life trusting you. I will leave now, I have to take Fatima to the doctor. Thank you. Hey, listen, wait. Where are you going? Wait. We just started talking. Please. Shaheer will get really upset
 if I don’t take his daughter to the hospital… He has you and his daughter 
caged in the four walls of that home. Is that what you left everything for? I am tired of all these things myself. If you are tired, then leave him. when you step out, 
a clear sky would be waiting for you to fly. You will never turn back and look. It is not that easy. Only one thing makes it difficult and that is Shaheer’s mad love for you. The love is lost somewhere. He doesn’t see anything else apart from his daughter. Then think yourself what 
is important for Shaheer. Sometime will pass and 
he will lose his heart to another girl. Where will you exist then, Sajjal? Today, the time is in your hands. Tomorrow you will only have regret. That is why you think hard once, that how long will you compromise 
with Shaheer’s mood swings? Think about it. Hey madam Irha, you? My heart is really worried brother Karamdad. My daughter is not well, I have to meet her. Go ahead. Fatima. Madam Irha. It is good that you came. Madam Fatima is really unwell. Take her to the hospital. She really has high fever. Do you people not take care of her? Come on, let’s take her to the hospital. Sure. Fatima. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. Thank God madam Irha that you came at the right time and
 took madam Fatima to the hospital. Seeing her condition, I got really worried. How could I find peace when 
my daughter is suffering? How could I not come? How can Sajjal and
 Shaheer leave her alone and go? Madam Sajjal had said that 
she would come back soon. But it is evening, she has not come till now. She is really careless towards the child, and sir doesn’t understand it. Hah, Sajjal is not a mother that she can understand such delicacies. Shaheer should take care of these things. Look. You please take care of Fatima’s diet. I got really worried. Madam Fatima got really unwell. If you cannot take care of your daughter, 
then give me her responsibility. Fatima will live with me. You have left this home and gone. Then fulfil the responsibilities 
of being a father with honesty. How is she now? Had madam Irha not come on time, then God knows what would have happened today. Madam Irha came as an angel today. Did you call her and ask her to come? No. No, sir. She is a mother. Even when she was away, her motherhood longed, and it made her stand in front of the child. So where was Sajjal? Sir, she got ready after you left and went. I tried a lot to stop her, but she didn’t listen to me and she told me not to tell you either. Sir, that…that… What? Go ahead? She will fire me from the job. 
Don’t worry about that. Tell me, what is the matter? She gets ready and 
goes away after you leave, and she has no set time to come back. I take care of madam Fatima, 
she is here with me. Because of her madam Fatima got so unwell. I was just leaving. Whatever you did for Fatima, I am indebted to you for that. I didn’t do anyone a favour taking care of 
my daughter. Irha, I asked you to leave in my anger, I did really wrong. You are a really good and responsible mother, 
who even when she is far cares for her daughter. If you want, you can come to meet Fatima, at any time. I have full hope that 
my daughter will not be left alone now. Someone will be with her. As far as taking care of her is concerned, 
then I have told Nafeesa. We have to give her 
milk before giving her the medication, or else the medicine will react. Just take care of all these things. Wont you stay for some time? I have full hopes that 
Fatima’s father is with her, and he will take care of her than me. I will ask the driver… I have both a driver and a car. 
Thank you very much. Everyone makes relations, but only a few know how to live with them. I wish you were faithful, Shaheer Ahmad, then today both of us would have 
been with our daughter. Your unfaithfulness ruined two relations. You will not be able to understand
 the relationship between a mother and daughter, because you live in relations out of need 
and not your heart.
