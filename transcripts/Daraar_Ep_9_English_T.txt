[18.96] We have caught a lot of criminals.
[21.04] Most of them 
have been involved in different robberies,
[25.20] and if we had taken the girl’s statement,
[29.32] that would have been better.
[31.60] By the way, who were those three 
boys on the motorcycle?
[34.44] It is better for her to know.
[36.72] Inspector, 
right now Irha is going through a trauma,
[39.92] and I don’t want that 
your questions worry her further.
[42.28] That is why I have brought Mr. Hamid along, 
you can ask him whatever questions you want.
[46.48] We have taken his statement,
[48.40] but a victim’s statement is far important than
 a witness’s statement.
[53.00] By the way, Miss Irha must have surely 
seen the face of the one who shot her,
[58.20] and she will surely recognize him
 after seeing him.
[60.20] How can you say this with so much surety?
[64.28] The CCTV footage we have taken out,
[66.64] the face of that boy is a little visible.
[70.28] And if Miss Irha sees him once then
[73.68] she will surely recognize him.
[76.84] It will also make it easy for us.
[79.56] I am sure,
[81.28] Irha will surely recognize him,
[83.88] because Irha
 has great memory since childhood.
[87.40] Think about it uncle.
[89.04] I don’t want that
 it increases tension in future.
[92.16] Shaheer son, 
it is our responsibility to get the criminals punished,
[96.56] and this is not possible without Irha’s help.
[101.84] Fine, 
you WhatsApp me that footage.
[103.88] If she recognizes them,
[105.72] then fine. 
If she is not able to recognize them,
[108.20] then it is your responsibility and
 you have to fulfil it.
[113.40] No sir, you rest assured.
[116.08] You trust us. 
you will not get a chance to complain from us.
[120.32] Thank you inspector.
[121.24] Can we leave?
[122.08] Mr. Shaheer,
[123.84] if you see those criminals once,
[126.60] then maybe it will be easy for you too.
[130.20] Sure.
[131.16] Come on.
[132.88] Thank you inspector.
[152.72] Ali, where is Shahrukh?
[156.20] I don’t know, he has not been coming to university 
for the past two to three days.
[159.80] Really? His phone is also off for the past 
two to three days.
[162.08] Where can he be?
[164.24] I don’t know.
[165.24] I have no idea. 
We thought you would know.
[168.00] No, I didn’t get in touch with him for two to three days. 
Okay, I will find out from his family.
[173.56] Okay, bye. Bye.
[187.36] Hello. Yes, Rida.
[189.24] Do you know anything about Shahrukh?
[193.12] Really. No, I didn’t talk to him 
for two to three days, his phone is off.
[198.12] There is no contact.
[200.80] Oh, even you don’t know.
[202.92] Okay, no problem.
[204.44] I will find out. Okay, thank you. Bye.
[218.88] The police has caught a few people.
[221.08] If you can recognize anyone of them,
 then it will be really easy to catch those people.
[225.80] Try that we find a clue.
[229.28] Shaheer Ahmad is absolutely right,
[231.56] you will have to help the police.
[236.16] I will try my best, uncle.
[239.72] Uncle, we should go to the police station.
[243.48] Son,
[244.84] we cannot take Irha 
to the police station in this condition.
[248.08] No uncle, she will not go.
[249.72] We will get on a video call from there.
[251.60] if she recognizes even one of them, 
then we will not have a problem in catching the rest.
[255.40] In fact, I will do one thing, 
I will call Sajjal to come here from university.
[261.24] She can stay with her, then we will go.
[264.44] She would have come from university,
she will be tired.
[267.20] Why do you bother her?
 I will take care of myself. You people go.
[272.00] I will do one thing,
[273.48] I will call the inspector 
to have the video call here.
[276.72] She will not have to be bothered.
[278.12] If this can be done, it would be great.
[284.32] He is not picking up.
[285.68] If there is a problem, I will call the nurse.
 You people please go.
[290.48] Okay, fine. Come on.
[407.36] Sajjal?
[411.68] Sajjal, what are you doing here?
[413.56] Where are you for so many days?
 Your number is off, Shahrukh.
[416.60] You are not even coming to the university.
[418.20] What happened?
[419.16] Look, Iet me call you when I get free.
[421.28] I will tell you everything,
 but right now I cannot tell you anything.
[423.44] But what happened?
[425.00] Tell me something, at least.
 What is the issue?
[428.12] I cannot tell you right now.
[429.24] Please leave from here right now
 or both of us will get in trouble.
[431.40] Why can you not tell me?
 What happened?
[435.80] Murder.
[440.12] What?
[441.32] Murder? Whose murder?
[443.88] Come inside.
[448.20] Who has been murdered? 
What happened? Who did you kill?
[451.00] Look, I didn’t shoot anyone on purpose,
[452.88] the gun fired on its own. 
You have to believe me, I am innocent.
[455.88] Shahrukh, I don’t understand anything, 
where did you get a gun from?
[458.96] Me and a few friends went on an adventure,
[461.48] and then everything went wrong.
[465.28] Someone loses their life for fun?
[468.00] What are you saying?
 I don’t understand anything.
[470.72] You…if the police comes after 
you what will you do?
[473.96] have you thought about it?
[475.68] Did you say anything to your dad?
 Did you tell him anything?
[479.28] Right now, I cannot say anything to anyone.
[481.24] Please, you too leave from here.
[483.56] How can I leave from here?
[486.00] I love you.
[488.84] My love will get you trouble.
[498.52] Go, search the whole home.
[500.56] Check inside. Check properly.
[505.84] Shit.
[509.68] Who is this? What is happening?
[511.60] Shahrukh, tell me something.
[514.32] Police.
[516.56] Police?
[520.40] Look, we know you are inside.
[522.64] If you want to save your life,
[524.44] then open the door
[525.64] or else we will break the door 
and come inside.
[528.28] How is my daughter now?
[530.96] Does it hurt a lot?
[533.12] I am much better than before.
[536.20] You tell me, 
did you people go to the police station?
[540.04] I got a good news for you.
[543.76] The criminals got caught?
[545.60] He will get caught.
[548.64] Shaheer has gone to his home 
address himself.
[553.28] But why did Shaheer go himself?
[555.68] You should have told him not to.
[557.76] Child, I had told him not to.
[559.92] He says that till the time I don’t catch him
 by the collar and hand him to the police,
[565.36] I will not sit peacefully.
[567.12] But uncle, 
Shaheer shouldn’t have gone himself.
[571.08] God forbid if something goes wrong,
then?
[573.92] No child,
[575.12] the SHO went himself,
 the whole force went with him.
[578.32] You just pray that everything goes fine.
[581.08] You did all this, right?
[583.44] Me? I will bring the police?
[585.60] What is wrong with you? 
You are doubting me?
[587.84] Before today the police
 has never come outside my door,
[590.16] then how did they suddenly come today?
[591.76] how can you even think this, 
Shahrukh?
[593.80] Why would I bring the police?
[595.32] I love you. Fine.
[598.72] You love me, right?
[600.68] Then come on. 
Come to the police station with me.
[602.88] No. No. I cannot go. 
Have you gone mad?
[605.68] My family will drag me out of my home.
[607.24] Take me out of here. 
Is here a door here?
[609.88] Listen, you love me, right?
[612.00] Come with me, No, I don’t want to go.
 No. No. Look,
[616.24] I will count till three.
[618.04] If you don’t come out till I count till three,
[620.72] then I will shoot.
[623.76] One,
[625.80] two….
[627.80] One second.
[629.28] One second.
[632.72] Come on.
[637.16] Search the home quickly.
[638.88] See if he has any other accomplices?
[641.04] Go quickly. You go this way.
[649.20] Hasn’t Sajjal come till now?
[651.88] No.
[653.80] it is possible 
she went straight home from university.
[657.52] I will call her.
[659.16] Uncle, 
ask the doctors to please discharge me.
[662.40] What are you saying, child?
[663.80] Till the doctors don’t allow you,
[666.08] you will have to stay here.
[668.40] I am bored lying here.
[670.96] I can even rest at home.
[673.76] Please ask him to let me go. 
Look, Irha child,
[676.40] you know 
what Shaheer Ahmad was saying?
[678.80] He says that till the time Irha doesn’t regain complete health,
 she will stay in the hospital.
[683.80] And I will support him in this matter. 
Okay?
[689.12] I will call Sajjal.
[690.96] Also ask Shaheer if he is fine.
 Yes, child,
[693.84] I will also call Shaheer. 
First let me call Sajjal.
[699.84] God, please help me.
[702.32] Just get me out of this problem, somehow.
[705.16] Oh God, please. Please. Please.
[718.72] She is not answering her phone.
[721.52] I will call again.
[742.52] Sir, there is a girl here as well.
[746.20] Okay,
[747.52] so you he hid the girl here.
[752.04] Sir, I found a girl here. Sir.
[755.76] You keep an eye on him.
[763.44] I didn’t do anything.
 I didn’t do anything. Please,
[766.56] let me go home. Please. 
Brother, let me go home.
[769.64] Sir, 
this is the other accomplice of that boy,
[772.80] who I am sure 
was involved in illegal activities with him.
[775.96] Now you tell sir everything honestly.
[777.68] I didn’t do anything, I want to go home. 
Please,
[779.80] I am telling you the truth. 
Please. Please let me go home. Please.
[783.96] Everyone says the same thing after getting caught.
[786.48] Now you will tell us everything quickly 
when you go to the police station.
[788.80] I didn’t do anything, please. Madam,
 if you want us to be lenient with you,
[793.00] then tell us everything yourself.
[794.80] Or we will have to inform your family.
[797.76] Then think you will get badly defamed
 because of it.
[801.84] Tell me, 
who else is involved in this game apart from you two.
[805.40] Sir, there was no one.
 I just want to go home. Please…
[809.24] Take her. Come on madam.
[811.48] Bring her.
[812.56] Come on.
[818.68] Move. Move.
[823.52] Come on, move. Move.
[832.04] I didn’t do anything, what are you…
[841.20] Shaheer, you?
[843.12] Sajjal, what are you doing here?
[845.44] Do you people know each other?
[847.28] No, I don’t know why they brought me.
[849.56] I am not involved. I don’t understand anything.
 Save me, please.
[853.08] Tell me, what are you doing here?
[855.24] Do you know 
this boy made a murder attempt on Irha.
[858.76] What?
[862.08] Shahrukh, shot Irha…
[864.56] He shot her.
[870.20] But what are you doing with him?
 and how did you get here?
[873.16] I will tell you everything honestly, 
please take me out of here. Please.
[876.96] Shahrukh..
[883.04] SHO, this is Irha’s sister,
[886.16] she has nothing to do with
 this boy or his group.
[888.56] Let her go.
[890.08] Be careful Mr. Shaheer,
[891.56] what if there is a problem in the future.
[894.20] Let us be a little satisfied.
[895.76] I am satisfied.
[897.56] They are sisters and 
they live in the same home.
[899.76] And then why would 
she support her sister’s criminal?
[905.72] Look, 
nowadays no one is true to each other.
[908.88] Let us investigate this girl a little.
[912.24] Shahrukh is my class fellow. 
I don’t know all this.
[915.72] Why would I do it? Irha is my sister, 
I cannot do it. Shaheer take me out of here…
[919.76] I trust you.
[921.40] I trust you.
[923.52] Please. Mr. SHO, he is the criminal, 
she just came to meet him.
[927.68] You investigate him, 
he will tell you everything.
[931.20] and the attack
on your fiancée can be a result of jealousy.
[938.36] What are you saying?
[940.04] Shahrukh, 
why don’t you tell all of them the truth?
[942.44] What do I have to do with all this?
[944.72] Shahrukh, you tell them the truth. 
Why are you not saying anything?
[951.84] Sajjal is right.
[953.80] She has nothing to do with this accident.
[956.72] She didn’t even know that
 I have made the attack.
[960.12] Did you people hear it?
[962.76] Fine, you can take her.
[965.40] Hey, come on, make him sit in the car. 
Come on.
[968.04] Take him along. If you support them,
 I will not leave you.
[979.76] Come on.
[997.00] There is a limit to carelessness.
[1000.12] Hey,
[1001.32] where does Sajjal keep her phone and forget.
[1005.52] Hey, Shaheer Ahmad is calling.
[1008.64] Yes, son Shaheer, go ahead.
[1012.60] Really?
[1014.96] Oh wow.
[1016.80] Fine son, 
I will come to the police station right now.
[1022.44] Child,
[1024.08] it is a good news for you.
[1025.96] Your criminal has been caught.
[1028.44] Uncle, this is really a good news.
[1031.24] I am going to the police station.
[1033.68] I don’t know where this Sajjal is, 
she is not answering her phone.
[1035.96] I will ask Noshaba, she will come to you.
[1038.36] Hey, why do you worry?
[1040.12] I am fine now.
[1041.80] You go, you go without worrying. 
Nothing will happen to me.
[1044.88] What are you saying, child?
[1046.96] God gave you a second life.
[1050.12] Thank God your criminals have been caught.
[1053.16] I will get them the most strict punishment.
[1058.12] Irha, child,
[1060.24] Shaheer is a really good man.
[1062.48] Really sincere.
[1064.40] Care for him.
[1065.76] He is someone who cares for relations, 
he is decent and respectable man.
[1071.32] Only people with good fate find such men.
[1077.12] Okay? I am going to the police station.
[1080.48] I will not leave him.
[1094.44] Do you have any idea that 
had I not come today what the police would have done to you?
[1098.28] They would have taken you to the police station, 
they would have called the media,
[1100.56] you wouldn’t be able to face anyone in the city.
[1103.44] Sajjal, do you have any idea 
what your parents would have gone through.
[1107.04] How can you be an enemy of your respect? 
Did you really not feel scared?
[1110.52] For God’s sake.
[1112.04] Please, don’t tell my family anything.
[1114.92] Papa will kill me.
[1117.44] Please, take me out of this in anyway, 
please.
[1120.76] You should have realized this earlier,
 Sajjal.
[1124.44] How can you even meet such a person 
who is involved in a crime?
[1129.84] I swear to God,
[1131.36] I didn’t know that Shahrukh is such a boy.
[1135.24] If I had known that he attacked Irha,
 then would I have come to meet him here?
[1141.60] I really don’t know 
this Shahrukh who can take someone’s life.
[1147.36] Who can rob someone.
[1153.32] Okay, stop crying.
[1155.48] Calm down
[1158.36] and tell me, 
how long do you know this boy for?
[1161.76] And Sajjal,
[1163.20] the truth can save your life and respect too.
[1166.24] So tell me.
[1167.80] He studies with me in university.
[1171.08] He was not coming over for two to three days, 
I got worried, so I just went to his home.
[1175.44] So how do you know about this home?
[1177.48] These people don’t live here.
[1179.56] Shahrukh did his birthday,
 he called us friends.
[1183.92] I just came once then, 
and the second time today.
[1191.16] You take an off from 
your university for a few days.
[1194.20] I will talk to the SHO and 
get this matter sorted.
[1199.24] Please.
[1200.52] Please, don’t tell my family 
or Irha about this. Please.
[1206.36] I won’t.
[1207.80] But if something like this happens, 
then it will be really difficult for me to hide it.
[1212.88] I cannot reach to help you all the time.
[1215.48] Drop me here. I will go home.
[1217.16] No, I will drop you myself.
[1219.32] Now I cannot take the risk of leaving you alone.
[1222.88] Thank you.
[1228.64] Shaheer is doing all this as 
my future brother in law and I…
[1237.24] What are you thinking?
[1240.12] Nothing.
[1255.36] Where were you?
[1260.40] Where were you?
[1262.32] Stop asking me this question.
[1263.80] When papa asks me, I will tell him.
[1265.84] I have a really bad headache,
 I am going to rest for a while.
[1268.72] The dinner needs to be cooked, 
it has to be taken to the hospital,
[1271.32] and if it is not made, 
your father will create a scene.
[1274.08] I am not cooking any food. I told you,
I have a headache, I need to rest for a while.
[1279.56] I know everything.
[1281.92] You don’t know anything. Quiet!
[1286.56] Where were you all day long?
[1288.84] If I ask you for something small,
 it raises hell.
[1292.40] Yes,
[1293.88] you look like someone from an innocent 
and decent family. And you.
[1298.36] You look like their leader.
[1300.12] Who are you? Who are you? 
You too are involved with them.
[1303.84] You too are involved. Huh?
[1306.32] How long have you people been doing this for?
[1308.40] How many robberies have you people committed?
How many people have you robbed?
[1311.08] Tell me everything
[1312.36] or else I will call your parents here
[1315.36] and show them your reality.
[1317.16] Tell me everything, honestly.
[1319.08] I am telling you.
[1320.28] I will you everything. Sir, please.
[1322.88] Please forgive us. We made a mistake.
[1325.20] You made a mistake? You made a mistake?
[1327.84] Now you remember your mistake?
[1330.64] Did you not understand this earlier?
[1332.76] The result of doing these things has a bad end.
[1337.28] I made a mistake.
[1340.08] Sir. Sir, we will tell you.
[1341.60] We will tell you everything.
[1343.12] Sir, please.
[1344.76] You will tell me everything honestly.
[1346.64] Yes, sir. Khan Mohammad. Yes, sir?
[1349.88] Record their statement.
[1352.20] I will come meet them in a while.
[1355.48] Okay sir.
[1363.08] Yes.
[1368.52] Tell me everything honestly.
[1373.68] You shouldn’t have gone there, Shaheer.
[1376.72] If something had happened, then?
[1378.64] What would have happened?
[1379.88] Anything could have happened.
[1382.16] If the police and criminal had a fight,
 a gun was fired…
[1387.44] what was the need for you to go.
[1390.20] For me, the most important thing 
was to get your criminals caught.
[1393.56] For that even if I had to play on my life,
 I would have.
[1396.84] What are you saying?
[1399.28] God forbid something happens to you
ever.
[1402.20] I pray that you get my age too.
[1406.16] I don’t want a life where you are not there.
[1409.40] I want to live with you forever I live.
[1412.64] And our life has still not started and 
you are talking about dying.
[1418.04] Do you love me so much?
[1422.00] Love is not the right word.
[1424.72] What I feel for you, to express that emotions, 
word won’t be enough.
[1430.36] Just never be worried 
of the intensity of my love.
[1436.04] Okay, don’t be so filmy.
[1440.60] Tell me, who were those boys?
[1443.60] Spoiled brats of rich parents.
[1446.00] Who consider robbery 
as fun in the name of adventure.
[1451.64] It is something so wrong.
[1453.76] It sure it.
[1455.84] But what do those poor parents know.
[1458.32] They send their children to college to study,
[1460.92] and how would they know 
what they do they in the name of education.
[1464.72] Yes.
[1471.88] Son, there is a good news for you.
[1474.08] The doctor is saying 
they will release you from the hospital tomorrow.
[1478.84] Thank God.
[1480.24] This is a good thing.
[1481.64] I will send the car in the morning,
it will drop you people home.
[1485.04] In fact, do one thing, 
keep the car with you till you need it.
[1489.76] Shaheer son, thank you very much.
 It is enough if the driver drops us home.
[1495.64] Son, 
all that you have done for Irha and for us,
[1501.56] we cannot thank you. Live long, son.
[1505.00] Uncle, please.
 Irha is now my responsibility.
[1521.96] What did you do, Shahrukh?
[1526.56] You were going to ruin me with you.
[1532.32] Thank God, Shaheer came there
[1535.84] or else the police would have taken me along.
[1540.08] I wouldn’t have been able to face anyone.
[1557.36] Papa, please.
[1560.16] Papa, please, take me out of here.
 Papa,
[1562.24] I have not done anything. Please.
[1565.00] I have seen the list of your adventures
with my own eyes.
[1568.64] You don’t need to say anything.
[1571.08] I feel disgusted calling you my son.
[1574.24] I am sorry, papa. I am really sorry.
[1576.96] You take me out of here once,
 I will fix everything, papa.
[1579.88] Papa, please take me out of here today.
[1581.36] Your bail has been rejected.
[1584.08] You cannot be released without the court’s order.
[1586.84] What do you mean it got rejected?
[1589.48] Papa, please take me out of here.
 How can you do this with me?
[1592.40] They are powerful people,
 the orders have come from their seniors. I cannot do anything.
[1596.28] Use your sources.
[1598.64] How can you let me stay here?
 Papa, please.
[1601.28] I am. I am. I am trying.
I will go and call again.
[1605.96] Pray that God has mercy.
[1608.08] You talk to Sajjal once,
[1610.04] she can help us.
[1611.80] She will talk to her family, papa.
[1614.40] Sajjal?
[1616.12] Who, Sajjal?
[1618.16] She is my friend.
[1621.40] The girl I shot,
[1623.92] she is her sister.
[1626.40] Do you have her address?
[1628.32] No.
[1629.40] But I have her number.
[1631.12] I will give you her number, you talk to her. 
You try to convince her, papa, please.
[1635.20] Tell me.
[1673.80] Careful.
[1678.96] Come. Carefully.
[1688.04] So many flowers?
[1693.40] Such pretty flowers.
 Who sent them?
[1700.04] Who can spend so much on flowers 
other than Shaheer Ahmad?
[1703.36] You know, we can get a month’s grocery at 
our home in so much money.
[1708.72] Come on, Irha. I will drop you in your room.
[1710.80] Okay wait.
[1712.32] Once you drop her at her home,
[1713.92] keep all these flowers in her room.
[1716.44] What if the neighbours see it and think that
[1719.16] Hamid Ali has started a flower business.
[1722.08] Sure, mama.
[1725.96] Hey, Noshaba, be happy for a change.
[1728.80] Don’t you see, 
they are such pretty flowers.
[1731.80] We will have to agree to something that 
Shaheer Ahmad has a great choice.
[1736.84] And I don’t need to worry about the neighbours.
[1739.32] They can say what they want.
[1741.04] I don’t care about anyone.
[1743.20] Yes,
[1744.88] I have a good idea of his madness seeing all this.
[1749.64] Hey, be quiet for a change.
[1752.84] Don’t you see,
[1754.00] Irha has returned home after so long. 
You are always speaking nonsense.
[1763.40] Come on. Careful.
[1769.08] Slowly.
[1772.28] Sit here comfortably. Here. 
Sit comfortably. Watch out.
[1779.76] Okay,
[1783.00] you rest here, 
I will bring something for you to eat.
[1786.08] Okay listen,
[1787.96] I don’t feel like eating anything.
[1790.72] Just keep the flowers outside, in the room.
[1794.96] They will die in the sun.
[1799.16] You are really worried about the flowers.
[1802.60] Did you ever think that 
you would get someone as loving as Shaheer Ahmad so easily?
[1810.92] You know, he is crazy after you.
[1813.16] Should I consider it a taunt or a praise?
[1817.08] Hah, if you want to consider it,
then consider it my desire.
[1820.88] It can be any girl’s dream.
[1826.00] It seems like a dream to me.
[1832.12] It is a reality,
[1834.84] but as beautiful as a dream.
[1844.48] Did you find out anything about that criminal?
 Did Shaheer tell you something?
[1848.56] Yes, he told me everything.
[1850.16] What?
[1851.44] What did he tell you?
[1852.60] That the criminals got caught on spot
[1855.00] and the proceeding will be done further, 
and…
[1859.00] What happened? Why are you so worried?
 Is everything fine?
[1862.40] No. No. Why would I worry?
[1864.64] Such a big accident happened,
so I need to ask.
[1869.20] Anyway, leave all this.
[1871.24] You rest here, I will bring your flowers.
[1882.32] Hello. Yes, who is this?
[1885.56] This is Sajjad. Shahrukh’s father.
[1889.24] Yes, uncle. Go ahead.
[1893.48] Why did you call me?
[1895.52] It is because child, 
only you can save Shahrukh.
[1902.64] What can I do uncle?
[1905.00] Whatever Shahrukh did was wrong, 
and he will get punished for it.
[1908.68] Child,
[1910.20] we are really worried.
[1912.76] His bail has been rejected.
[1915.24] You do anything and convince your family
[1919.76] or else my son’s future will be ruined.
[1924.56] No uncle, I cannot do anything.
[1927.08] If my family finds out that he is from my class,
 then they will make me sit at home. I cannot do this at all.
[1933.40] Your sister survived, right?
[1936.40] So you can make one attempt to save Shahrukh.
[1942.12] Look, child, 
I will not forget this favour of yours all my life.
[1946.08] Please. Please.
[1950.20] Okay fine, 
I will try but I cannot make any promises.
[1954.64] Goodbye.
[1973.88] No need to be scared grandma.
[1975.60] That boy was no illiterate person,
[1978.72] he is from a good family.
[1980.60] Educated.
[1983.96] Scary, if these boys do this.
[1986.28] Excuse me, grandma.
[1991.00] Yes, Sajjal, go ahead. Is everything fine?
[1993.60] Shaheer, 
I want to talk to you about something important.
[1996.16] I am listening.
[1997.44] Shahrukh’s father called.
[2000.08] Shahrukh’s bail has been rejected, 
he is really worried.
[2003.76] So they should be, what can we do?
[2005.88] I know what Shahrukh did was wrong,
[2008.60] but if Shahrukh’s bail is rejected then
it will be worse.
[2012.92] He will be rusticated from the university, 
his family won’t accept him, his life will be ruined.
[2017.96] Please, do something.
[2019.04] You are taking the side of the 
boy who made a murder attempt on your sister?
[2024.04] I am disappointed.
[2025.48] How can you even think this?
[2028.56] He didn’t know it was Irha,
[2030.60] and after all the gun fired by mistake.
[2032.92] And thank God, it didn’t do a lot of damage.
[2035.72] I am sorry, Sajjal, but I am not in the mood 
to be lenient with that boy in this matter.
[2039.60] Shahrukh’s father will get him out on bail,
[2042.16] but if you would have…
His father can do what he wants,
[2046.44] then I will do what I want.
[2057.72] What happened? 
Something to worry about?
[2059.48] No, grandma. All this goes on.
[2062.16] You tell me, 
when are you going to meet Irha?
[2064.64] tomorrow.
[2066.44] In fact, when I go, 
I will also fix the wedding.
[2069.48] What do you think? 
Why ask before doing a good deed.
[2071.92] If it was in my control, I would have made her 
my bride and brought her home today.
[2076.60] Is your tea cold?
[2119.00] Hello. Look uncle,
[2120.68] I have spoken to him already. 
He cannot do anything in this matter.
[2123.76] You stop bothering me.
[2125.52] Thank you. Goodbye.
[2131.60] Who was on the phone?
[2133.32] And why are you so worried?
[2136.20] No. No. A friend called. 
She was asking about Irha.
[2139.56] Okay,
[2141.36] so you too have made an announcement throughout
 Pakistan like your father. Huh?
[2145.16] Every other person is coming to see her 
or they are eating my brains by calling on the phone.
[2149.84] Mama, such a big accident happened, 
so people will ask.
[2152.80] Okay. Okay.
[2154.00] If you are so interested in having a crowd here,
[2156.64] then come and serve them too.
[2158.72] People from the neighbourhood have come,
 make tea and bring it.
[2161.40] And bring it soon.
[2162.92] What if you keep on sitting here, 
thinking and they leave.
