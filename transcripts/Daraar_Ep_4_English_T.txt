[27.20] You killed my Hamid Ali.
[29.96] Leave from here.
[30.72] Get lost.
[31.20] Mama,
[31.68] let me see papa’s face…
[33.20] You are dead for us.
[37.00] your infelicity didn’t end.
[38.52] You didn’t stop.
[40.08] You took Hamid Ali’s life.
[42.28] I say leave from here.
[43.44] Leave from here,
[44.16] or I will take your life.
[45.64] Leave.
[46.20] Get of here.
[58.92] There is no place for you in this home,
[60.32] get lost from here.
[61.76] Our relation has ended.
[64.44] And if you step in this home,
[67.40] you will see my dead face.
[69.56] Leave from here.
[70.96] Get out of here.
[71.76] Get lost.
[73.44] Tell her to get lost from here.
[107.72] What happened?
[111.72] I was a little busy in office,
[113.36] that’s why…
[117.36] You were busy in the office?
[121.12] You are still worried about your office.
[122.96] Do you have any idea the torture I am going through?
[125.68] What happened, Sajjal?
[127.48] Are you okay?
[128.84] Did your mama and papa not forgive you?
[173.96] What happened?
[176.20] My papa passed away.
[179.80] Oh my God.
[181.44] Oh my God.
[193.36] All this…all this happened because of Irha.
[197.28] My mother pushed me out of the house.
[202.92] In front of Irha,
[203.84] in front of the neighbours.
[207.28] Irha believes in herself that 
she will come back to this home.
[213.36] I will surely take revenge from her.
[217.32] I will show her.
[219.84] She thinks she will come back to this home?
[223.68] What will you do?
[228.92] I will get her divorced.
[230.72] You will divorce her.
[232.92] You will divorce her! You will divorce her,
[237.12] I am saying you will divorce her,
[240.08] and you will divorce her soon.
[241.60] When will you divorce her?
[243.88] I hear you.
[244.56] I hear you.
[245.80] I have heard what you said.
[246.92] But you are not answering what I am saying.
[249.12] You will divorce her.
[251.04] You will divorce her.
[253.04] Okay. Sit.
[258.08] Irha will not live in this home now,
[259.84] okay?
[260.84] This is your home.
[262.36] Only you will live here.
[267.00] Divorce Irha.
[378.12] Irha, child,
[379.84] this is for you.
[381.56] Hey,
[382.28] it is really a pretty dress.
[384.12] Thank you so much.
[385.12] You liked it, right?
[386.12] Yes.
[386.76] It is pretty, right?
[387.32] Yes. It is pretty.
[387.80] Sajjal, child, this is for you.
[392.56] You got this for me?
[394.24] I don’t want to wear it.
[395.56] Is this even a colour to wear?
[398.92] You are my trust,
[401.88] my pride.
[404.96] Just always maintain it.
[408.64] Papa, I can never break your trust.
[411.52] I have an arrest warrant against you
[413.68]  for the allegation of stealing a diamond ring for a jewellery shop.
[416.20] Your daughter has stolen a ring worth two hundred thousand.
[418.92] I don’t want to go anywhere.
[419.80] Take her along.
[420.64] They are trapping me.
[421.24] What are you doing?
[422.00] Take her.
[422.56] Your daughter has given me
 a good name in the world.
[426.28] Shameless!
[427.28] Hey,
[427.84] Hamid Ali.
[429.40] Show her how she has made her father proud.
[434.00] Papa,
[434.84] this…I…
[436.68] That’s it.
[437.68] After today,
[439.32] if you step out of this home,
[442.00] then you will see the worst in me.
[446.92] Not even a leave can move in this home without my order.
[450.40] Me and a few friends stepped out for an adventure.
[452.88] And then…then everything went wrong.
[455.80] Look,
[457.48] I will count till three.
[459.36] If you don’t come out till I count three,
[461.84] then I will shoot.
[464.12] Sir there is a girl here too.
[466.80] So you have hid the girl here.
[469.68] Shaheer,
[470.56] you?
[471.56] Sajjal, what are you doing here?
[473.64] Shahrukh’s father has said that
 if you don’t get him released on bail,
[480.44] then…
[482.04] Then? Then what did he say?
[485.32] Then Shahrukh will leak my video.
[488.92] Shaheer is a decent boy from a good family,
[491.68] we cannot even like this about him.
[498.76] I left you here to take care of Irha,
[505.36] not to interfere in their lives.
[508.84] It would be better that you mind your own business.
[512.08] Both of us love each other
 and we will get married really soon.
[526.64] Did you not have shame?
[530.60] You are the daughter of a religious father.
[535.08] You should have had some shame and cared a little.
[538.76] You have forgotten the respect of
 relations and your shame completely.
[548.72] Nothing you people say will change my decision.
[551.88] And if you people don’t want to keep a relation with me,
[554.20] then don’t.
[554.80] even I am not interested in keeping
 a relation with you people.
[557.80] How are you talking to him?
[559.96] Have you forgotten?
[561.32] He is your father.
[563.08] Noshaba,
[564.80] leave her.
[571.08] She has become ill-mannered and shameless.
[575.00] Her conscience is dead.
[577.92] You people have heard Sajjal’s decision.
[581.80] You can go.
[583.28] We too don’t want to keep a relation
 with this cheap and shameless child.
[593.40] She is dead for us.
[595.08] So why are you standing here?
[596.24] Go from here.
[604.32] Hamid Ali.
[605.12] Hamid Ali.
[606.24] Papa.
[607.92] Papa.
[676.16] Don’t touch him.
[677.84] Get out of here.
[679.20] You are the murderer of my Hamid Ali.
[681.64]  You killed my Hamid Ali.
[683.84] Leave from here.
[684.92] Get lost from here.
[685.80] Mama, let me see papa’s face once.
[687.40] You are dead for us.
[689.48] Our relation is over.
[692.20] And if you step in this home,
[694.96] you will see my dead face.
[697.48] Leave from here,
[698.68] get out,
[699.68] get lost.
[760.64] How long ill you mourn?
[765.40] This had to happen one day.
[770.76] Till the time I don’t take revenge for my insult,
[773.00] I will not sit peacefully.
[777.60] What is the need to keep 
a relation with those people?
[780.84] It is good,
[782.04] enjoy your life happily.
[786.96] I will,
[789.80] but after I punish Irha.
[795.72] What will you get out of it?
[798.12] She has been punished enough already.
[802.52] Why do I feel that you don’t want to divorce her?
[809.00] You are imagining things.
[812.12] Then why didn’t you send the divorce papers till now?
[817.96] There is some property in her name.
[820.68] if I divorce her, then she will get it and I don’t want that.
[825.04] To make her happy, you put all the property in her name.
[828.72] and for me?
[830.88] Just consolation and hopes of conditions getting better.
[835.64] Why have you started to become
 too disappointed towards me?
[838.52] So, what else do I do?
[841.96] You have no idea about my worries.
[845.84] I left everything and came to you.
[848.16] I put everything on the line and you…
[856.40] Sajjal, I understand 
[858.52] but I am caught up in my own worries.
[860.36] I am really worried.
[861.76] How do I fulfil all your wishes in this condition?
[865.68] Shaheer, do you feel that I want all this?
[868.56] I didn’t mean that.
[871.44] I am saying that I am really worried,
[873.88] I am facing losses in the business.
[877.64] So all this worry is not because of me.
[880.32] Instead, I am getting insulted,
[882.00] I am being shamed because of you.
[887.08] Think about it.
[889.08] Sajjal.
[890.48] Sajjal,
[891.20] please,
[891.88] listen to me.
[948.96] If he doesn’t care about me,
[950.52] then I don’t care about him either.
[952.32] Maybe Shaheer is taking me for granted.
[969.60] I am sorry,
[972.32] I didn’t mean that.
[973.96] You got hurt for no reason.
[977.32] Does anyone get hurt on purpose?
[983.48] Your tone is so strange for me,
[986.64] like whatever problems are there in your life,
 they are because of me.
[991.56] When did I say that?
[994.08] Your style makes it all evident.
[997.08] Is there even a need to ask?
[1000.64] If you are tired of me,
[1002.04] then tell me,
[1002.64] I will leave the home and go.
[1005.16] Okay, forgive me, please.
[1007.12] It will not happen in the future.
[1009.04] If you want, I can hold my ears.
[1013.12] You don’t get upset with me.
[1015.28] you get upset with me, 
and life becomes difficult for me.
[1018.40] Then why do you do  it?
[1020.40] You know I get mad.
[1024.60] I just want to see your madness for me,
[1027.96] don’t waste it in your anger.
[1032.48] Okay fine,
[1035.04] then you divorce her as soon as possible
 and also take back all the property.
[1041.64] All your wishes will be fulfilled.
[1044.80] Okay?
[1092.76] Why are you removing this, child?
[1098.00] When the relation is broken,
[1099.00] then why do I even keep the things connected to it.
[1102.80] You will see Irha,
[1105.08] one day Shaheer will really regret it.
[1112.04] And Sajjal,
[1115.16] she won’t even find a grave after she dies.
[1122.76] Don’t curse her.
[1128.08] What are you made of?
[1131.24] She snatched everything from you,
[1134.20] and you…
[1137.96] you know well,
[1142.44] she is a snake in the sleeve,
[1146.00] still we had hopes from her.
[1150.04] She can bite anyone when she gets the chance.
[1156.40] You just pray for me that I get patience for all my life,
[1165.76] Oh my child.
[1198.32] You will find it.
[1205.00] I got a call for a couple of interviews,
[1209.08] you just pray for me.
[1214.28] you will get that job.
[1216.64] You will surely get the job.
[1219.04] If you get busy,
[1221.20] it will be easier to forget your sorrows.
[1234.56] As soon as you go for the interview,
[1237.40] I will pray for you immediately.
[1241.16] The company will offer you a job immediately.
[1245.32] Yes.
[1247.32] You get ready I will make breakfast.
[1264.76] What is this nonsense?
[1267.64] How can our loan get rejected?
[1270.04] Sir our company has already
 defaulted from the bank already.
[1273.20] We cannot get further loan.
[1274.84] Then think of another way.
[1276.72] Standing quietly here won’t do anything.
[1279.48] Sir, there is a solution.
[1280.88] If you can do that.
[1282.32] What?
[1283.00] Tell me.
[1284.36] Sir, you remember,
[1285.68] you bought a property in the name of Miss Irha 
[1288.44] and you bought a property for the orphan house.
[1291.76] If we sell it,
[1293.64] we can profit a lot.
[1299.40] Why did I not think of that earlier?
[1301.20] Sell that property.
[1303.32] Sir, but I don’t think Miss Irha will agree.
[1308.00] She and I have had a separation.
[1310.24] I don’t think she will have
 a problem returning something I gave her.
[1313.72] You get the papers ready,
[1314.92] I will talk to the lawyer myself.
[1317.36] Fine,
[1317.92] I will talk to the dealer myself.
[1325.00] Yes, Mr. Ayaz.
[1327.04] Very good.
[1327.96] You bring the papers by the evening, I will sign them.
[1331.04] It would be better if you come to the office.
[1333.16] Thank you.
[1429.20] Miss Irha, 
[1431.36] you used to work in an insurance company?
[1433.76] Yes, sir.
[1437.04] I don’t remember where I have seen you.
[1441.20] I have not seen you there.
[1444.48] Why does it matter, sir, where you saw me.
[1447.88] You have to give me the job based on my capability,
[1451.44] I remember.
[1453.08] You are the wife of the industrialist Shaheer Ahmad.
[1456.92] He owns a big company,
[1459.68] why do you need a job?
[1463.44] Sir, every person has some problems,
[1466.36] some helplessness.
[1468.64] Obviously, I cannot discuss those personal matters.
[1472.32] But I really want this job.
[1475.44] And I promise you that I will not disappoint you.
[1478.92] I will work really hard.
[1481.16] So, please.
[1484.40] Miss Irha,
[1486.36] we don’t have a job that is worthy of you
[1491.32] and we cannot upset Mr. Shaheer Ahmad.
[1495.48] Sorry.
[1498.20] Sir, I need this job.
[1499.88] I really need this job,
[1501.00] please.
[1502.08] And then nothing like this will happen.
[1503.36] You believe me.
[1504.96] Miss Irha,
[1506.48] this is what you are saying,
[1508.76] but the reality is completely different.
[1512.48] I am sorry.
[1532.76] Sajjal.
[1536.24] Shaheer, you?
[1537.64] I didn’t even find out.
[1541.08] Actually, I wanted to give you a surprise,
[1543.36] so I couldn’t stay in office,
[1544.40] so I came.
[1545.40] A surprise for me?
[1547.44] What is this?
[1548.80] You always have this complaint from me that 
I have never put anything in your name.
[1553.48] This is an apartment and a few shares of my company.
[1556.56] From today you are a shareholder in my company
 and you have your own apartment.
[1562.52] What? Really? Honestly?
[1564.56] Of course.
[1565.72] But your company just faced a loss,
[1567.88] then why all this for me.
[1572.48] Because I cannot see you sad.
[1575.48] No matter how much loss I have in business,
[1577.56] you will always get profit.
[1581.96] You are so good, Shaheer.
[1584.56] I am so lucky that I found someone 
so good and loving like you.
[1590.12] I am the lucky one who got your love,
[1592.68] just always be mine.
[1596.08] Is this even something to say?
[1598.84] I will always stand by you.
[1600.48] Yes, that’s it.
[1602.16] That’s all I want.
[1640.52] Don’t worry child,
[1643.08] God must have something better in this.
[1647.52] You don’t worry,
[1648.28] don’t get disheartened.
[1651.60] It is something worrisome aunt.
[1657.08] Where ever I go for a job,
[1660.04] they hear Shaheer’s name and says no.
[1663.60] My capability,
[1664.40] my experience means nothing.
[1668.96] Okay listen,
[1670.80] my heart says you will find a really good job one day.
[1676.52] I should find it now.
[1679.16] I don’t want to be a burden on you.
[1682.36] and I have to take back Fatima from Shaheer.
[1685.64] This will only be possible 
when I am able to stand on my feet.
[1692.20] I have an idea, child.
[1695.24] It is really difficult for you to
 live your life without your child.
[1700.40] But child,
[1702.52] on one hand,
[1705.00] she is there with her father,
[1708.00] she is living a life of peace and comfort.
[1711.16] And the luxuries Shaheer can give her,
[1714.48] you cannot even give them even if you want.
[1718.68] But what do I do with this heart,
[1720.72] that is restless for it’s child, aunt.
[1725.40] I am unable to sleep all night.
[1727.68] Fatima’s voice is echoes in my ears,
[1730.40] she is calling out to me.
[1732.12] I don’t know what condition she must be in.
[1733.56] I don’t know how she will be living without me.
[1737.92] Just have faith in God.
[1740.44] I am completely sure that 
[1742.48] one day God will bless you for your patience
[1746.68]  and your motherhood will find peace.
[1750.24] Don’t worry child,
[1752.44] God will make it all fine.
[1818.20] Good morning.
[1900.20] Thank you.
[1901.92] I am sorry Miss Irha,
[1903.84] we have selected our candidate.
[1906.40] Apologies for making you come over.
[1936.52] I don’t know what helplessness Mrs. Shaheer 
has that she is searching for such a job.
[2005.24] What?
[2005.92] What are you doing?
[2008.00] Your daughter is really cute,
[2011.64] Just like my Fatima.
[2016.16] Now Fatima too must be six months old,
[2020.24] she must get up and sit.
[2023.04] And after two months,
[2025.92] she will also start running.
[2030.28] I am just really unlucky
 that I cannot spend time with her.
[2035.24] But where is your daughter?
[2042.48] She is in a really good place.
[2045.80] Where ever she is, she must be really happy.
[2087.76] and a plate of french fries.
[2089.64] Okay.
[2090.80] Buddy, I need to take this call,
[2091.92] I will be back.
[2093.68] Now are leaving like this 
during family time for a call.
[2096.92] Some family time…
[2097.92] Just two minutes.
[2101.52] Oh God.
[2103.72] Can you not see?
[2105.04] Leave it.
[2105.76] Stop it.
[2106.76] Be quiet.
[2107.60] Why don’t you listen to me?
[2114.40] What is the need to scold such a small child?
[2117.20] Don’t you see how much she is screaming?
[2123.12] Everyone must be looking,
[2125.12] what do I do?
[2125.84] Look at her.
[2126.88] You think it makes a difference to me
 what others think about us?
[2130.80] All I am asking is that you fix 
your behaviour towards the child.
[2133.84] My behaviour should be good?
[2135.72] Should we not teach her something?
[2137.72] She is a small child.
[2139.68] What do you expect from her?
[2144.44] Did you see?
[2145.08] Did you see?
