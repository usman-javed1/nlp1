[45.56] Did you see your position in this home?
[51.36] In Shaheer’s heart?
[73.72] Now, no need to murmur.
[75.88] If you stay in a corner of this home,
 then you will save yourself from being kicked around by the world
[94.52] or else even you 
wont be able to live a life without luxuries now.
[188.88] What did I not give you?
[193.16] Money. Fame. Respect. This name.
[195.92] Where ever you go,
 thousands of people go around you,
[199.08] because you are my wife.
[203.76] I took you from the ground and 
made you sit in the sky and this is how you repay me?
[219.24] It was my fault.
[221.36] It was completely my fault that
 I took dirt from the road and put it on my head.
[225.96] The way you are being so stubborn in front of me,
[228.40] it is only because of me.
[233.00] Or else, what were you?
[235.24] An ordinary insurance company’s employees, 
who used to walk around for a few thousands.
[243.40] I changed your worth.
[249.24] Did you see your position in this home?
[251.12] In Shaheer’s heart?
[254.32] Now, no need to murmur.
[256.40] If you stay in a corner of this home, 
then you will save yourself from being kicked around by the world
[263.68] or else even you 
wont be able to live a life without luxuries now.
[279.64] Don’t forget one thing.
[282.00] This home is not yours, it is mine.
[284.56] Everything here is mine.
[286.32] Whatever happens here will be by my will.
[293.36] Sajjal is living here by my will and 
she will not go anywhere.
[319.08] So she is robbing my right 
with your own will?
[408.96] Did your heart not shudder stabbing me in the back?
[415.76] You are my sister, right?
[418.20] Is this how sisters are?
[420.52] Why don’t you ask this question to 
your husband who went mad in my love?
[429.68] If your love had power, then you should have stopped him.
 Why are you blaming me?
[447.44] when ruining my home?
[450.40] Did you not feel ashamed for a moment,
[453.72] Did you not even realize it a little?
[458.00] I only had this home with me, 
that you snatched from me.
[462.76] You are overreacting for no reason.
[467.32] What is the big deal in this?
[469.80] Let whatever is happening, happen.
 No one will find out anything.
[473.04] No, Shaheer Ahmad, no.
[477.08] You have really wronged me.
[482.76] So decide today.
[485.88] Fix your mistakes, and confess your sins.
[489.32] And decide who will live in this home.
[495.48] A husband’s job is not to give his wife money,
 fame, wealth, jewellery, money, Shaheer.
[505.04] A husband’s duty is not to pick her 
from the ground and make her sit on the sky.
[509.24] The relation of a husband and wife is that of trust,
[512.36] love,
[514.16] faith and belief.
[520.40] But that is no longer in you.
[524.68] You have changed, right?
[528.00] So you have forgotten all relations.
[534.32] Thank you so much for reminding me of my worth.
[539.60] But the painful thing is that all this is true, 
Shaheer.
[548.04] Elders have said correctly,
[550.64] the love of man is like a fountain in the mountain,
[557.40] it doesn’t go on, it stops.
[563.04] But a woman,
[566.52] her love is like a stream, it keeps on flowing,
[570.28] it keeps on flowing. It never ends.
[578.44] This is my love,
[580.28] towards you and 
my daughter that is stopping me
[588.36] or else I would never have tolerate all this.
[605.12] I can do justice with both of you.
[609.68] Sit comfortably. Die of shame, Shaheer.
[615.00] I have made my decision.
[618.08] Now you need to decide.
[665.72] Thank you, Shaheer.
[672.20] Today you made me believe 
how important I am for you.
[678.68] Why? Did you not believe me earlier?
[681.00] Love is such a thing,
[683.60] it needs reassurance day and night.
[692.76] Okay leave all this.
[694.84] Let’s go for lunch today.
[697.00] Just you and me.
[698.88] Your mood will get fine, 
and we will talk about the future as well.
[703.72] Yes, let’s go.
[706.36] You can say this with a smile on your face as well.
[710.00] Why are you spoiling your mood?
[723.68] Your companionship is so beautiful that 
I can never be sad.
[735.44] Just never leave me and go.
[738.12] I have burned all the ships and come.
[742.96] I will live with you all my life.
[747.88] These things you say win my heart.
[755.76] I want to put everything 
I have on the line for you.
[762.92] I am the one you were searching for,
[768.88] for ages. Leave her. We will make our own world.
[773.52] In which only you and me will be there,
[776.08] and our love.
[780.20] What you want will happen.
[784.04] Then hold your heart today.
[869.52] We have enjoyed so much today.
[872.28] Huh?
[873.52] It felt like the biggest burden 
of the world has been removed.
[878.00] I didn’t want to come back.
[880.64] I will have to see her crying face again.
[882.96] Yes,
[883.80] she was really looking like a heroine from the 70s.
[886.00] My home, my husband. It is all your fault.
[889.84] She is not worthy of you at all.
[895.28] At times a person is unable to think.
[898.36] But anyway,
[900.00] you are in my life now.
[901.84] I have no sorrow.
[903.72] Now fix your mistakes as soon as possible,
[906.60] and send her away from this home.
[908.92] Before she says all sort of things to mama and papa.
[914.40] What are you afraid of now?
[915.68] She has found out everything.
[918.20] You have no idea,
[919.84] she is really dear to papa.
[922.16] And if papa finds out, 
then he will take severe decisions.
[928.56] Now I have come in your life,
[930.92] so you don’t need to be afraid of anyone.
[934.24] When you have burned all the ships,
[936.36] then believe me.
[938.04] I will never let you down.
[940.80] I had burned them, 
the moment is stepped in your life.
[945.20] I was only afraid that
[946.96] the time and situation might change you.
[950.28] But now I don’t even fear that.
[953.24] Then enjoy your life to the fullest,
[955.72] because life is really beautiful.
[957.92] And you are more beautiful than life.
[964.64] That’s Fatima crying.
[966.20] Please go and check what happened to her?
[968.40] What is wrong with you Shaheer? She is a child, 
if she doesn’t cry, then what will she do?
[972.32] She must be hungry, 
or maybe Irha is changing her.
[975.60] Why are you spoiling your mood?
[977.32] Go check on her once, please. 
She has never cried like this before.
[982.76] I don’t want to see her face at all.
[987.64] If you want, can I get coffee made for you?
[990.20] Yes, please get it made.
[997.84] What happened to her? 
Why is she crying so much?
[999.92] I don’t know sir, I have tried my best, 
but she is not getting quiet.
[1004.40] Where is Irha?
[1005.92] She didn’t inform me before leaving.
[1009.60] Did she take her things along?
[1011.04] No, she left empty handed from here.
[1014.56] Come on, give her to me. Give her to me.
You have made her cry so much.
[1017.24] Go get her milk. Yes, sir.
[1019.24] That’s it. That’s it. Papa is here. That’s it.
[1022.08] That’s it. Well done.
[1024.16] Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl.
[1028.60] Okay?
[1029.72] Yes. Yes.
[1033.04] Now you are not crying, daddy is here.
[1036.76] It is okay, everything will be fine.
[1038.64] Papa is here, everything will be fine. Okay?
[1103.40] Why are you holding her?
[1105.60] Where is Irha?
[1107.04] She is not at home.
[1110.00] Why? Has she left the home and gone?
[1112.32] I don’t know,
[1113.84] but I am angry how 
she left the child in this condition and went.
[1118.28] She is torturing you on purpose.
[1120.64] This is just a move of hers.
[1142.68] These cheap moves of her wont affect me.
[1145.88] I can take care of my daughter myself.
[1149.04] Okay, give Fatima to me,
[1151.04] and check where she went.
[1153.84] No, she is sleeping. If I give her to you, 
she will get disturbed. Leave it.
[1165.64] The SP is calling?
[1167.16] Is everything fine?
[1168.16] You give Fatima to me, and attend the phone.
[1175.12] Here. Careful, please.
[1181.04] Hello.
[1182.40] Yes, greetings Mr. SP.
[1226.04] When I left for the police station, 
I found out that they shifted you from there.
[1232.24] Are you fine, Sabira?
[1234.24] Sister Irha, I have not done anything.
[1237.16] For the sake of God, take me out of here.
[1240.88] A false allegation has been put on me. 
I have small children.
[1245.00] I know you have been blamed.
[1247.96] I have come to you for this truth.
[1251.20] But now you will have to tell me the entire truth.
[1256.28] Sister Irha, the truth is really bitter,
[1260.60] you will not be able to tolerate it.
[1263.80] If I tolerated becoming an orphan in childhood,
[1267.24] then I will also be able to tolerate the truth of 
my husband’s unfaithfulness, Sabira.
[1273.60] You tell me what happened?
[1276.40] Madam Sajjal used to go around Mr. Shaheer all the time, 
since she had come here.
[1283.04] One night
[1284.40] when madam Sajjal was leaving 
Mr. Shaheer’s room,
[1289.08] madam saw her.
[1294.20] She was really hurt. 
She couldn’t tolerate all this.
[1316.24] Did you share any details with her?
[1318.92] Okay.
[1320.48] She didn’t file an FIR, right?
[1324.80] Alright.
[1326.00] Fine. Thanks for informing me.
[1327.88] Do keep me in the loop. Bye.
[1330.80] What happened?
[1332.04] What was the SP saying?
[1334.36] Irha went to the police station.
[1336.24] What?
[1337.36] Police station?
[1338.60] Why did she go to the police station?
[1340.08] I don’t know.
[1342.16] You should find out, 
what if she is filing a case against you.
[1346.28] She doesn’t have the courage to
 take a step against me.
[1349.28] The real reason is something else.
[1350.60] When she comes back we will find out.
[1352.60] You should still find out.
[1354.92] What if, she takes such a step that 
can lead to your defamation?
[1359.00] That is not possible with me alive.
[1360.84] I have to make a couple of important calls,
[1362.52] you please stay with Fatima. 
Don’t leave her alone.
[1365.36] Yes, don’t worry.
[1436.52] Where are you coming from so late at night?
[1442.52] Why do you care?
[1444.28] I care,
[1445.72] because legally and
 religiously you are still my wife.
[1448.52] I have the right to question you, 
and ask you for answers.
[1453.36] You remember your rights,
[1457.88] but you have forgotten all your responsibilities.
[1460.20] I don’t want to get into a useless discussion again.
[1464.44] Why did you go to the police station?
[1468.84] This means I have been spied on.
[1471.28] I have my eye on everything.
[1475.32] Why did you go to meet Sabira?
[1477.52] To know the truth.
[1480.28] The cheap allegations that you
 two have put together on that poor, innocent woman.
[1488.68] You got her punished.
[1490.56] Did you not feel ashamed even once?
[1502.44] Where is your conscience dead, Shaheer?
[1506.28] Where have you put your conscience to sleep?
[1511.60] Grandma died 
because of your shamelessness and disregard.
[1521.64] The same grandmother 
who used to have faith in you.
[1524.36] But you didn’t have shame.
[1525.88] You are crossing your limit.
[1527.44] You have crossed your limit.
[1537.04] Someone who doesn’t remember anything.
[1541.68] Not the family name,
[1546.44] nor rules, nor respect for relations.
[1549.48] Stop this nonsense or else…
[1551.12] Or else what?
[1554.00] What will you do?
[1558.96] You will divorce me?
[1568.44] Or will you leave me? 
Or will you drag me out of the house?
[1579.92] That wont be necessary,
[1585.76] because before that 
I am leaving you and going myself.
[1599.96] Because not I am disgusted by you.
[1607.04] I feel suffocated in this home of yours.
[1636.52] Yes, but before I leave, 
I surely want to ask you a question.
[1645.16] She was in the habit to put her respect 
and name on the line from the start.
[1667.72] But when did you fall so low?
[1679.48] What did you see in her?
[1685.68] Peace.
[1690.16] Happiness.
[1692.08] Feelings.
[1693.60] Something I don’t get from you.
[1696.68] Oh,
[1700.08] I will disappointed that 
I tortured you for so long.
[1707.88] But now you two can choose each other.
[1720.20] Because naturally such girls don’t settle to one man.
[1743.24] And such men don’t live with one woman either.
[1748.28] Listen to me. Stop.
[1751.04] Why are you creating a scene?
[1755.12] In the eyes of the world you are still my wife.
[1761.12] If you want, you can stay.
[1762.36] No, Shaheer Ahmed.
[1769.36] A woman will not be helpless every time.
[1868.96] Leave her.
[1870.32] She will not go anywhere from here.
[1872.32] Fatima is my daughter, Shaheer.
[1875.88] You cannot do this injustice with a mother. 
She will live with me.
[1879.52] She has a home,
[1880.92] a respectable father.
[1882.48] She is not an orphan and hopeless like you.
[1884.36] Give her to me.
[1885.40] But I too have no other reason to live.
[1888.44] She is my last hope.
[1891.00] I will never give her to you.
[1892.68] I told you, Fatima won’t go!
[1894.16] If you want to leave from here, then leave.
[1896.00] She won’t go from here.
[1897.24] After all, 
you are in the habit of going around aimlessly.
[1899.20] Give her to me.
[1900.44] I don’t have a sister, a brother, or parents.
[1903.56] She is my entire world.
[1906.20] You cannot snatch her from me. 
You cannot be this cruel that you are even forgiven, Shaheer.
[1911.64] Give her to me. Don’t do this. 
Give her to me.
[1912.92] Shaheer, give me my daughter.
[1914.44] Shaheer. Shaheer, Fat…
[1919.08] Shaheer. Shaheer. Shaheer. Here you go,
[1922.72] from today you are her mother.
[1924.16] When she grows up, 
tell her that her mother died at birth.
[1926.60] No. Give me my daughter,
[1927.96] don’t be so cruel that 
God closes the doors of forgiveness on you.
[1930.40] What will happen with me, will happen.
[1933.00] I too will see what can you achieve after the label of 
Shaheer Ahmed is removed from you.
[1936.36] Shaheer, please… You still have time.
[1939.24] If you love your child so much,
 then live in this home quietly, respectfully.
[1943.40] This cannot happen.
[1946.04] Then Fatima too won’t go anywhere.
[1974.96] If you step out of this home, then remember, 
coming back won’t be possible.
[1986.84] What sort of a mother are you, Irha?
[1988.96] How can you leave a few day old child, 
and go like this? Are you not ashamed?
[2119.76] What will happen with me, will happen.
[2122.52] I too will see what can you achieve after 
the label of Shaheer Ahmed is removed from you.
[2125.88] Shaheer, please…
[2127.24] You still have time.
[2128.72] If you love your child so much, 
then live in this home quietly, respectfully.
[2133.00] This cannot happen.
[2135.56] Then Fatima too won’t go anywhere.
