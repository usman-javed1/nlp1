What will happen with me, will happen. I too will see what can you achieve after the label of
 Shaheer Ahmed is removed from you. Shaheer, please… You still have time. If you love your child so much, 
then live in this home quietly, respectfully. This cannot happen. Then Fatima too wont go anywhere. Stop. Why are you creating a scene? In the eyes of the world you are still my wife. If you want, you can stay. Come in. What is the matter? Sir, settle my account. Now I don’t want to live in this home. What happened to you? Where are you going? This home is not worth living in now, sir. I feel suffocation in the air of this home. Forgive me, sir. But I was living here for madam Irha. When madam Irha is not here, then I don’t deserve to stay here. I didn’t pay you a good salary for Irha. Maybe, you are forgetting it. Along with the money, the respect I got from her, no other woman can give it. And I cannot even think about it for madam Sajjal. Shut up. What nonsense is this? Do you have no manners to talk? I would say, 
settle his account and send him away. If you are mistaken that you too will leave from here, and I will stop you,
 then nothing like that will happen. I don’t make anyone my helplessness. Sajjal, settle his account, and give him more than what he deserves. Giving less is against my respect. Here you go and get out of here. And I too pray that I never come face to face with me in my life, because the woman who breaks the heart and 
home of her sister, neither the world forgives her, and nor does God. I told you to get lost. Get out of here. What did you see in her? Peace. Happiness. Feelings. Something that I don’t get from you, now. Oh, I will be disappointed that 
I kept you tortured for so long. But now you two choose each other, because by nature such girls don’t settle for one man. And such men don’t stay with one woman either. Uncle. Irha, child, you are here at this hour? Please. What happened? Irha. Oh God, what happened to her? she seems to be in a really bad condition. Irha, be strong. Listen, take her inside, 
I will go call the doctor. Okay. Okay. Careful. Careful. Careful. Hey child, what happened? Oh God, Nafeesa, make her get quiet. 
Why is she not getting quiet? Sister, I am trying in front of you. I even gave her milk, but she is not getting quiet. What happened? Give her to me, I will make her get quiet. My child. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. Why is she crying so much? Obviously, her mother is not there, 
so she will cry. That’s it. Be quiet. That’s it. You got tired of her so quickly. Give her to me. Hey, I am not tired, I am just saying that 
the child will cry without her mother. Why don’t you return her? Okay, sister Noshaba, I will leave. Doctor, is there something to worry about? No, nothing to worry about. I have given her a sedative, 
she will wake up in the morning. Doctor, what happened to her? She is going through a mental trauma, because of which her nervous system has been affected. If she rests, she will be fine. Don’t worry. Thank you very much. Come on. Papa’s princess doesn’t have to cry. Don’t cry at all. Good girl. I love you. I love you. You made her stop crying. How did you do it? I am her father, she was at peace when she came in my arms. Okay, give her to me. I will leave her in the room. She will disturb you at night. No. No. She is at peace right now. If you hold her, she will get disturbed. Leave it. But she will wake up at night, your sleep will get disturbed. I will drop her. I will manage. I can do this much for my daughter. No problem. Should we call Shaheer or not? I don’t know if Irha informed him
 or not before coming. Shaheer must be worried. If there was something like that, Shaheer would have called and
 found out till now. But I don’t know why, my sixth sense is telling me that
 these two surely had a fight. That is why she left the child there as well. Hey, I didn’t even think about the child. Hey, Sajjal is there, ask her what happened. Sajjal should have ideally come back with Irha. Hey, it is also possible that 
she stayed there because of the child. But how is this possible? 
She could have called. She could have informed us by calling. I…I will call Sajjal. I will call Shaheer, talk…
 No need to call Shaheer. When he is not calling us himself, then why should we call him? Shaheer really loves Irha. Then what happened, 
that she had to leave home. Hey, right now we don’t know 
if they had a fight or something else happened that she came. May God keep everything fine. I pray to God that she regains consciousness, 
then only will we find out the real thing. When Irha came home and fainted, her condition was clearly saying that 
something undesirable has happened. I pray to God something like that has happened. Who is calling? Why are you not answering it? What do I say after answering it?
 Irha must have told them everything. So? All this had to happen one day, you wanted it yourself. What is the problem? All that is fine, Shaheer, but it will happen suddenly like this,
 I didn’t think of this. and Irha’s reaction was so strict. You know how beloved she is to papa. 
How much he loves him. You are worried about your image? Yes. Wont I be worried? On one hand you claim to have burned all boats in my love and on the other hand you are worried about your family. How will you face the world? I am not stepping back from anything. I am just saying that if all this had happened in a reasonable manner, 
then it would have been better. Homes don’t break in a reasonable manner. Anyway, I have removed the complaint you had from me. Now it is your turn. Switch off your mobile and forget your old life, this is better for the both of us. On one hand you claim to have burned all boats in my love and on the other hand you are worried about your family. How will you face the world? I am not stepping back from anything. I am just saying that if all this had happened in a reasonable manner, 
then it would have been better. Homes don’t break in a reasonable manner. Anyway, I have removed the complaint you had from me. Now it is your turn. Reaching so close to the destination and 
stepping back is nothing but stupidity. No, I cannot bargain on my dreams. Mama and papa will get really upset right now, but after some time they too will agree. Life has blessed with a lot of difficulty, and I cannot let go of this opportunity. This home, wealth and Shaheer, everything is only mine. Only and only mine. And I too pray that I never come face to face with me in my life, because the woman who breaks the heart 
and home of her sister, neither the world forgives her, and nor does God. I told you to get lost from here. Get lost. She was in the habit from the start to put her respect and 
name on the line. But when did you fall so low? If you step out of this home, then remember, 
coming back won’t be possible. What sort of a mother are you, Irha? How can you leave a few day old child, 
and go like this? Are you not ashamed? Are you awake, child? Your Irha is ruined, uncle. Don’t say that child, have faith in God. God will fix everything. Nothing will get fixed. Everything is over. Irha, child, what happened? What did Shaheer say? Shaheer has left me and he even snatched my daughter from me. Shaheer likes someone else, uncle. He wants to marry her. I have no problem. He can marry who he wants, 
he should just give me my daughter. I cannot live without Fatima, uncle. Irha child, you stop crying. everything will be fine. You used to say that Shaheer can give his life for you, then what is all this? The one who could give his life, 
is adamant on taking my life. Smart people have said correctly, a man is a snake. No one knows when he will bite. What woman came in between you two because of which he forgot about his wife 
and his daughter? When the foundation of your own home is weak, then how can someone complain to the 
person throwing stones? I am not disappointed that 
someone else’s magic worked on Shaheer. In fact, I am disappointed that 
he has forgotten my faithfulness. Hamid Ali, why are you sitting quietly? 
Say something. You will have to go talk to Shaheer. There is no need to talk to anyone, aunt. Just bring me my daughter back, 
I cannot live without her. I cannot live without Fatima, aunt. Please. Okay. Everything will be fine, child.
