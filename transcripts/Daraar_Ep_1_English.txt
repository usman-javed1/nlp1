Where are you coming from this hour? I went out with friends, I had a lot of fun. So was it so necessary for you to go that 
you left Faitma unwell and left. Hey, what is wrong? It was just a little fever. What is wrong? There is no big deal in it. And after all, children get fever. Nowadays the weather is such that 
every child catches fever. This was no ordinary fever. 
Had she not reached on time, then she could have lost her life. But why would a woman like you care, 
who sees no one other than herself. Excuse me, you are saying this to me. If Fatima is not my daughter, 
then she is your real daughter. If you were so worried,
 you should have stayed back and taken care of her. If I didn’t have an important meeting,
 then I would never have gone. If you were helpless, then I too was helpless. 
I couldn’t cancel my plans either. I have not given you freedom that 
you ignore the home and child all day long. I am not your slave that I obey your restrictions. This is my life and it is up to me how I live it. If you really liked restrictions so much, 
then why did you let her go? She enjoyed all these restrictions. At least she cared about her home and child. If she was not here today, 
then something bad would have happened. Oh, so this is the effect of her meeting that
 you are taking out all the faults in me. Does she want to come back to this home 
because of her daughter? Stop your nonsense. I have divorced her, okay? 
I will not hear any nonsense about her. Then why do you feel so much pain for her? I am not a child, 
that I don’t understand anything. You are regretting leaving her. actually, you deserve her. You are crossing your limits. 
You are crossing your limits. What do you want to say? 
She is a good girl, and I am a bad girl. How did you give her permission 
to come to this home? She is her mother, she can meet her when she wants.
 This is her right, no one can take it from her, and if you don’t like it so much,
then learn to stay at home. You are out all day long, 
you go to parties, I don’t like it at all. I shouldn’t hear after today that 
you went out anywhere. and what if I don’t listen to you, then? You will have to listen to me,
 because this is my home, and what I want will happen here. Then you too hear me out clearly, I cannot live in this prison. What did you say? Exactly what you heard. Look, is she fine now? Did she sleep well at night? 
Did she cry a lot? and you feed her something after every three hours, if she has weakness, she will fall ill further. And if there is any issue, call me and ask without hesitating. Where is Mr. Shaheer? Okay, fine. Yes, so what is the problem? Buy the shares from the loan we got from the bank. As soon as we get profit, we will return it. Sir, we have already purchased a lot shares
 for Sultan Group of Industries from the loan. Now we don’t have any more money to buy more shares. We will have to think of something else. Sir, did you talk to miss Irha 
in regards to the property? Yes, but I am not taking that property from her. We will have to make other arrangements. What is the minimum amount we need? I think two to two fifty million would be fine. What this will be is we will be able to survive and we will be able to pay off the bank loan 
with the money received from the profit. I will arrange this much. I have some more property, I will sell it. Give me some time, I will send you the documents. If this can be done soon, then I will talk to the dealer and 
make arrangements for the money. We have already made a big move already. The one who wins the move is considered the winner. I will send the documents till evening. Okay sir, thank you. Bye. Sajjal. I am here. You didn’t go to the office? No, I thought I would work from home today. After all, you complain that I don’t spend time with you. So here I am. I have to go to a committee party, my friends must be waiting for me. You won’t go anywhere, please. It is necessary for me to go, I will come back soon. Mrs. Zubair asked me with so much love,
 so I couldn’t say no to her. There is no need to go. I am at home, so you should be at home too. And then Fatima is not well either. You know if I don’t go, 
then people in the circle will talk. What the world talks about,
 I don’t care about it, and neither should you. It should be important for you what I think. What is this doing here? Why is it not in the locker? I got this. Maybe I forgot to tell you. It is ordinary. Looks quite costly. What is going on, Sajjal? What? Are you doubting me? I am scared seeing your changed behaviour. What is this love that wants to keep me chained, it makes you doubt me,
 it makes you get upset with me. I get helpless in your matter. I don’t know what I say. I am sorry. Please don’t mind. Okay listen, let’s have lunch together. It has been so many days that 
we have not eaten together even. Please. I am not hungry. If you are hungry, then ask Bilquis, 
she will make food for you. I am getting late. I have told you, you will get your order. There are delays in work. God damn it. I got this. Maybe I forgot to tell you. It is ordinary. Hello. It has been long that we met. Yes, I am a little disturbed for the past few days. Why? What happened? You know the situation is not good. The business is a little down. Yes, I found out a little. Not from you, I found out from others. It is not reasonable to talk about these things on the phone. Can you meet me? But where will we meet? I have a meeting in a hotel, 
I will send you the pin. I will also send you the room number. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. What is happening with me? Along with the business, 
even Sajjal is looking away. There is something that 
Sajjal is changing so much. I too got impressed by your personality and money. But this too is a bitter truth that men like us forget truth and 
honesty in our pride and ego. We are unable to see the cunningness and
 opportunity seekers hidden behind make up on faces. A man recognizes a woman well. His eyes even see what the woman cannot see. The goodness and 
truth of a woman is written on her forehead. Every experiment taught me a new lesson. The situation got bad, even Sajjal looked away. To hell with such wealth that blinds us. We are unable to recognize the faithful relations 
and people in front of us. We are unable to take care of them. What is your real sorrow for? For Sajjal? Or Irha? Or the loss in the factory? Till yesterday, I had everything, wealth, love, a faithful wife in the form of Irha. God even blessed me with a daughter. But I was blindly running after a destination that
 I would never be able to get. I left every relation one by one. I am tired of running in this race. No one is there to lift me up. Your daughter is still there in your life. If you look at the eyes of reality, you will see several ways to live a right life. Apologies to the people you hurt. How do I apologies to them? No one will forgive me. How do I find mercy in their heart? You even find God if you search. Look in your heart. Wake up your conscience. Seek forgiveness from God and everyone else. I will also go now. Maybe I too am looking for a right path. Bye. You, here? Shaheer called me to meet. Oh, liar, cheat, is cheating me. We have an old relation. I was helpless at the hands of my heart, 
so I came to meet him. Hah, how was the meeting? When two old friends meet, a lot is discussed, situation and condition too. Oh, discussion? So he called you for a discussion. Yes, we talked about happiness and sorrow. You talked? You can think what you want. Me and Shaheer have had a long 
and deep relation. You have told me that. He is broken Sajjal. You came to piece him back together? You can think what you want. Thank you so much, you arranged a party for me. it was a lot of fun. This was really less for you, Sajjal. You deserve a lot more than this. Do I also deserve Shaheer Ahmad’s unfaithfulness? Why, what happened? Did something happen? I met Zoya. Zoya. Why are you getting angry and 
burning your blood? Shaheer has always been after women,
 maybe you just found out. Thank God his real face came in front of me. He made a lot of promises, and claimed his love for me. Shaheer Ahmad cannot belong to one person. I know, but he was doing dramas of love with me. How was I to know he was so bad in intentions? He is a cheap, cheat, and liar. I had told you earlier, 
you are wasting your time after him. I won’t do it now. Hi. I want to spend time with you, 
and you are running away from me. Why are you doing this? You want to spend time with me? Yes. Then what were you doing with Zoya? Zoya? You have a misunderstanding…
Don’t talk nonsense, I know it all. What were you doing? Why? You can go, but I can’t? You are competing with me? Yes, I am competing because in your defeat is my win. Sajjal. Sajjal, please. I am already really worried, don’t bother me more. 
I need your help. Look, you always had this complain from me,
 that I don’t share my things with you. The property I gave to you, I need its documents. I have to sell it. What? You had gifted it to me, why should I return it? I know. I know. look, as soon as the company’s condition will improve, 
I will get you a better home than that, but right now, I need those documents. I will not let you get mistreated Sajjal and I find it really bad saying this to you, because it is not my nature 
to take back something I gave, but please. Sajjal, please, I need your help. I have invested that. Where did you invest it? I am asking you something. I invested it with Sultan Khan. What? You got into a partnership with 
my business partner without informing me? Have you gone mad? Yes, I have gone mad. What else could I do? I asked you so many times to get married. 
Stop putting allegations. This is not an allegation, it is the truth. You don’t give women more importance than a shirt. Stay in your limit, Sajjal. I stay in my limit and you cross all your limits? 
Be quiet. I won’t stay quiet. You cannot be trusted, you will bring another woman and 
stand up in front of me. So what would happen to me? I had to think of a backup for me, so I accepted his offer. And you know what? He is much better than you. in every way. I put everything I had on the line for you. I wasted my money, I wasted myself, for a cheap girl like you. and you got done with me, 
and you went to him. He is much better than you. 
A successful businessman and he takes care of me more than you. Like I don’t know this investment is just an excuse. The reality is that a loose character girl like you 
is impressed with his wealth, like you were impressed by my wealth. Am I lose character? Me or you? Don’t forget, 
you had a relation with other boys before you. Taking money from them was your habit. That Shahrukh. If I was not there, 
then you wouldn’t have been able to face anyone. And the other boy,
 who left the neighbourhood overnight and went. So don’t act so pure. If I was attracted towards you, then you shouldn’t have lost your way. But you, yourself wanted this. Okay. Now I understand why you didn’t marry me. You have so much hatred for me in your heart. Yes, you cannot be trusted. God knows what you will do after marriage. The world will spit in my face. You know what? It is done. I don’t want to live with you now. You deserve a girl like Irha, that’s it. Irha was a thousand times better than you. She was faithful. She considered the home a home. I left her for your sake, 
and this is what I got in return. And don’t forget that 
the way you are going around Sultan, all that too is because of me or else you were, 
zero. Zero! There is a big difference in fulfilling your wishes 
and making a home, Sajjal. But, a girl like you cannot understand this. Because you are only a beautiful deceit, nothing else. No matter what, I will not live with you. I am leaving. Yes, go, I will see how many days you survive without me. Leave. I have to meet you immediately. I have left Shaheer Ahmad. I want to shift to the new home immediately. If you step foot out of this home, then remember, 
you will never find these doors open. So take your step after thinking. Did you hear what I said? There is a crack in relations. This had to happen one day. You didn’t care about a faithful girl like Irha, then why do you have hopes tied 
to an opportunist like Sajjal. I had loved her with a true heart. Sajjal. I left my wife for her sake. I ruined my well-set home. How can she do this with me? She cannot cheat me, she had promised me. We had dreamed of living our lives together. You cannot make a castle of your dreams 
by bringing tears in someone’s eyes, Shaheer Ahmed. To make a home, 
it is necessary for two people to be faithful and honest. Even one person’s weak attachment, can become the reason for cracks in the hearts
 and relations. The crack not only ruins those two people, but even every relation attached to them. Then try to mend 
this crack in fate as much as you can, but whoever falls in this hole, they never come back. Neither Irha can come back, nor Sajjal. The crack you have formed, you have fallen in its pit yourself, Shaheer. There is a painful punishment for hurting heart. You have to pay a heavy price. This is the punishment you got for hurting Irha’s heart. Your destruction has been written, nothing can happen now. Because you have lost the time. Yes, Noman. What is the matter? What? How did the fire start? Is anything left, or did everything get burned? Okay, I am coming. Oh, how much is the loss? Nothing is left? Very sad. You people do one thing, 
cancel all shares of Shaheer group of industries. We don’t want to do any contracts with them. What happened with Shaheer Ahmed? He got the result of cheating a girl like you. A fire started in the factory, nothing is left. Everything went up in flames. What? I know he has really hurt you, but today, make me a promise. I shouldn’t see tears in these eyes after today. I was in love with him, but he wanted to chain me and control him. Then that life imprisonment is over. You are out of his control. He repaid me well for my love. It was all the intoxication of wealth. Now he will come to his senses. He is out of money. Think if the business is over, 
the person is over. I want to become a successful business woman. Absolutely, 
you should take your business forward. Shaheer’s love is left behind, never turn back and look at it. And don’t keep his hatred with you either, it will not let you progress. Go ahead, Noman. All the material for production got burned, sir, nothing is left. Everything burned down to ashes. We had got a loan on the same factory from the bank. And the contracts we had done, the deadline for delivery is near. All the material got burned, but we don’t even have money that 
we can make a promise. I don’t understand what will happen now. But how did this fire start? There was a short circuit. Some workers 
were also there in the factory at that time, those people also got burned and died. Their families will create a separate scene now, 
sir. You go, Noman. Famous businessman 
Shaheer Ahmad’s factory caught fire, because of which the company 
has faced a loss in billions. Because of this the company’s share 
value has gone down. All the companies that were shareholders with him, have announced to cancel all their shares. The business community has expressed 
their sorrow to the company owner, Irha, Shaheer Ahmed.  what happened? Shaheer’s factory caught fire. Everything got burned to ashes. All this had to happen. He had a lot of pride on his wealth and money. See. See, how everything burned down to ashes. Everything is ruined, Hey, what do we have to do with this? 
Huh? When he had made you cry 
and dragged you out, then wouldn’t your sigh have reached the sky? It surely must have. Now you will see after Shaheer’s destruction, how Sajjal will go around aimlessly. How can you curse your own daughter? The girl who has ruined 
the respect of relations after her desires, I don’t even want to hear her mention. And neither is there any room 
for her to seek forgiveness. And after today, you too hear it, I don’t want to hear her name from you at all. Now you pack the things, get ready. We will shift in our new home. Because I don’t want that 
I have to face Sajjal after Shaheer’s destruction. I don’t even want to see her. Sir, should I serve food? No. I took her out of my life, everything I had has been put on the line. I wish, unlucky me, was able to know her worth. This is how the emotions of love and hate are like. They chain your feet. I am not dependent on anyone now. I want to keep myself free. It is good. From today, start your new life. Yes, but not here. Neither with you, nor with anyone else. I have booked my tickets, I am leaving tonight. Thank you so much, you have really helped me, but now I want to be free from all this. Aunt, I will give the keys to the neighbours. They will open the door and 
get the home cleaned once in a while. When we don’t have to come back here, then what is the point of giving the keys? There is no need. Come. As you wish. Come on, child. Yes, Noman, is everything okay? I am coming to the office. Sir, there is a bad news. What? Sultan group of companies has cancelled all our shares. This had to happen. Sir, you already knew? Every person has such a time in his life when he witnesses the show 
of his destruction with his own eyes. But he is so helpless, he can do nothing. Think I am going through the same. What will we do sir? The bank loan is really high and even the factory has burden down. Try to buy shares of a small company that we get from the contract cancelation. But sir, what will that do? To start fresh, it is not important if the step is big or small,
 the step is important. We don’t have to give up right now. And I need you at this time. Sure, sir. Yeah. You? Fatima. Mama. Fatima. Mama. Go. You have set the home well. I didn’t do anything great in this. The company did all this. I had thought that you would not meet me. Irha, I had turned really evil. I had felt that no one can defeat me. Then time changed in such a way, that it threw me on the ground from the skies. In a few days, everything ended. I got insulted and 
defamed in front of the whole city. Yes, but I understood one thing. God lives in the hearts 
if you break a person’s heart, then God will get upset with you. I had thought that I am someone, who would touch anything and it will turn to gold. But I was wrong. Grandma was right, you are my lucky charm. When you came in my life, I forgot to lose. I didn’t know your worth, so I turned into dust. Even Sajjal didn’t leave me
 capable to face anyone. She said that I didn’t know your worth, 
so how would I know your worth. She was right. I couldn’t love anyone apart from myself. Irha, I didn’t come here to apologize and 
become good in your eyes. My sin is really big. I came here to hand over my daughter to you. I cannot trust anyone apart from you in the world. You will bring her up better than me. Are you going somewhere, Shaheer? I don’t know, what will I do, where will I go? I have darkness in front of me. 
I don’t understand anything. I just have one request from you. Make sure my daughter doesn’t hate me. Please. I have already fallen in my own eyes
 and the world’s eyes. I will not be able to tolerate my daughter’s hatred. No matter how bad character a man is, he truly loves his children. My daughter shouldn’t get punished for my sins. Make her like you. I knew your worth really late, Irha, but now I know it. I am really, really, sorry for everything. Even I don’t know
 if I will ever be able to forgive you or not. But just like I am Fatima’s mother, 
you are her father and Fatima is both our responsibility, 
not just one of us. Shaheer, I have decided,
 the two of us will bring up Fatima together. She will stay with you for a week and
 one week with me, and the two of us will have to live up 
to this responsibility well. We will have to do this for Fatima. This is a big favour you are doing on me. I am not doing anyone a favour. A child is the result of the love of two people. And if those two have a crack, then it shouldn’t impact the children. The mistakes of the parents 
shouldn’t come on the parents, or they become affected by inferiority complex even
 if you don’t want to. And I don’t want to bring up 
my daughter like this. If I keep her with me, 
then she will miss her father, if she stays with you, she will miss me. we cannot put our child in torment because of us. That is why, 
Fatima is the responsibility of both of us and we will have to live up to it with honesty. Thank you, Irha. Thank you so much. Believe me, I didn’t have a reason to live on, but your behaviour and 
goodness has given me new courage. I know, I couldn’t be a good husband, but I promise, I will be a good father. Thank you for supporting me at a time in 
my life when I was completely hopeless. Thank you. You don’t need to thank me. This is my responsibility and I will live up to it well becoming a mother. Hi. Having a good time. Shaheer, shall we cut the cake? Once Irha comes, we will cut it. Okay, so you have called Irha too? Of course, sister in law, she is both our daughter. It is necessary for both of us to be in her happiness. Excuse me. See, even though they got separated but together
 they are taking up the responsibility of the child completely. You are right. if not good life partners, but both of them are good parents. Oh, there’s my princess. Once mama comes, we will cut your cake. 
Mama is here. Oh.
