[17.12] Since I have come 
I am observing you are in the mood to bite.
[20.80] What has happened?
[22.64] You live in this home, 
you take care of the things here.
[25.48] If he doesn’t ask you, who will he ask?
[27.44] Now go.
[28.56] Go find his file. Come on, go.
[30.76] I don’t interfere in any of his matters.
[34.20] I told you, go find his file.
[37.12] He must need it.
[38.36] And show this useless tantrums later. 
Since you have been living here you have lost your mind.
[43.28] You came here to serve here,
[44.96] not to rule that 
you are throwing so many taunts at me.
[48.08] Okay. Okay, go. 
No need to speak so much nonsense.
[133.48] Thank God you came.
[135.32] I was afraid that in your anger you
 might tell something to aunt.
[138.80] Why did you call me here?
[142.28] I had hurt your heart,
[144.24] how could I not apologize?
[147.04] You realized this really soon.
[150.52] If I had not realized it, 
I would have been in the hospital right now.
[154.04] I was worried for you.
[155.32] Lies.
[156.76] Mama has told me everything.
[159.08] The hospital people didn’t let you stay there,
[162.28] or else you wouldn’t have left your daughter
 and wife to come to me.
[165.40] I am not worth that much.
[167.44] I lied to them.
[170.16] I made an excuse.
[172.72] Now pray that this excuse doesn’t get revealed,
[175.00] or else I have no excuse to justify what I said. 
Why?
[178.56] Why did you put yourself in so much trouble? 
Why did you leave your wife and daughter, and come?
[184.20] You cannot be so cruel.
[187.00] The ones who has wounded you is saying this.
[188.84] I am surprised.
[190.40] I also put an ointment on the wound.
[192.96] Listen,
[194.28] I am well aware of your pain.
[196.92] I know well the pain you are going through,
[200.12] and I am really sorry, 
I didn’t do anything on purpose.
[203.80] You have no idea what torture I am going through.
[208.28] I said I am sorry.
[210.16] I promise I will make amends for all sorrows.
[213.72] Just let me live with the world.
[215.48] It is necessary.
[216.80] her hold on this home has become stronger.
[220.08] No.
[221.52] Not at all.
[223.36] A woman’s hold is strong when she rules a man’s heart. 
And you own my heart,
[231.16] and not Irha. You can only talk.
[236.44] Okay listen, come. Sit with me.
[238.56] Come. Come. Sit.
[240.68] Sit comfortably.
[247.76] You took so long to find a file.
[251.12] I had found the file, mama.
[254.00] Really?
[255.48] Then where were you for so long? 
What were you doing?
[257.92] I was telling Shakur about the breakfast. 
We have to take breakfast to the hospital tomorrow
[261.00] and I have also made arrangements for your nihari.
[263.40] Okay, it is good that you told him.
[266.04] Okay, we will do one thing, 
we will go to the hospital early.
[269.48] Irha is not at home,
[271.16] and we are living in her home, I don’t like it.
[274.84] Are you not a little too worried about Irha, now.
[279.56] Idiot, if you were in her place,
[281.80] I would have said the same thing.
[294.64] This is what I am sad about mama.
[296.88] Why am I not in Irha’s place?
[302.60] What happened now? What are you thinking?
[308.28] Okay tell me, 
who does Irha’s daughter take up after?
[311.40] Shaheer or Irha?
[314.20] Right now she is in the emergency.
[316.56] You just pray that both of them come home safely.
[320.00] It will take them a day or two.
[321.84] Why? What happened?
[325.08] Hey, the child has been born premature.
[328.08] That is why Shaheer is so worried?
[332.56] Really?
[335.52] What do the doctors say?
[337.16] The doctors have given us a lot of hope,
[339.40] but we will find out 
the real thing when we go there tomorrow.
[342.88] You just pray to God that both of them are fine.
[347.20] I am really worried for Irha.
[350.92] For a mother,
[352.76] what can be a bigger sorrow than a child.
[357.48] May God have mercy.
[460.04] Good morning. Are you awake?
[464.28] Doctor, where is my daughter?
[466.36] She is in the nursery.
[468.56] But you cannot meet her right now,
[470.88] she is not well.
[473.20] My child.
[474.48] Where is my child, nurse?
[476.52] Is she fine?
[478.56] Take me to my daughter.
[480.68] I have to go to my daughter.
[482.36] There is nothing to worry about.
[484.28] Don’t stress out or you will get unwell.
[493.84] Shaheer.
[495.24] Where is my husband?
[497.32] Take me to my husband.
[499.28] Please. Please, nurse.
[501.68] Those people went back last night.
[507.52] Leaving me alone here?
[511.32] Yes, there were a lot of people,
[513.24] they said they would come back in the morning.
[515.76] Do you need something?
[526.48] Do you need something?
[546.24] He left without meeting me.
[550.20] Are so many distances created between husband and wife, 
when a child is born?
[562.56] When she doesn’t feel like it, 
why are you forcing her?
[567.56] You talk to your sister,
[569.56] she doesn’t listen to me at all.
[571.88] I am here to take care of her.
[573.84] you are getting late for your office,
[575.84] you get ready.
[578.48] You have made her dependent on you so badly.
[580.80] She argues with me on everything.
[587.92] I told you, you are getting late for office,
[590.52] and after all, when she is hungry, she will eat.
[614.04] Why can you not stay with me in this room?
[616.60] You know,
[618.32] I can only sleep in my room.
[623.64] Then take me to your room with you.
[626.52] After all, I am lying here alone.
[629.60] You are not lying here,
[631.04] you are taking care of our future happiness.
[634.36] And then you are not allowed to go up 
and down the stairs.
[636.96] You know that.
[638.12] I cannot take a risk.
[642.52] What happened?
[645.76] I don’t want to stay in this room alone anymore.
[649.20] I want to stay with you, 
I want to spend time with you.
[654.28] It feels like I have been imprisoned in these four walls.
[659.72] There is nothing like that.
[661.40] Just a little time.
[663.56] Where is my husband?
[665.60] Take me to my husband. Please.
[668.52] Please, nurse.
[670.00] Those people went back last night.
[676.12] Leaving me alone here?
[679.48] Yes, there were a lot of people,
[681.56] they said they would come back in the morning.
[684.08] Do you need something?
[745.72] Come.
[748.08] Good morning.
[754.68] Congratulations to you.
[757.84] Thank you so much Shaheer.
[760.36] Now get fine quickly, so that we can go home.
[776.40] You left me and my daughter alone here.
[780.40] I am sorry. Hospital rules. I was helpless,
[783.48] or else me and aunty wanted to stay here.
[785.48] What do you say, aunty?
[787.08] Yes, child,
[788.52] all night I couldn’t stay in your worry. 
As soon as it was morning,
[791.20] I told him to take me to my daughter.
[794.28] Tell me, are you feeling alright?
[798.16] What will happen to me?
[800.68] I am absolutely fine.
[803.80] But our daughter, Shaheer…
[807.52] the hospital people are not letting me meet her.
[809.64] I want to go with her. Please take me to her.
[813.72] But Irha how can you go in this condition?
[818.20] Sajjal is absolutely right.
[820.04] Hey, it is just wait till the evening,
[821.52] rest a little right now. 
You can go see her in the evening.
[826.68] Did you see our daughter?
[831.52] How is she?
[833.88] Me and Sajjal are going to see her right now.
[836.84] I will get her pictures for you on my way back.
[842.32] Aunty, shall we go?
[844.12] Yes. Yes. Child. Go ahead.
[845.84] I will give Irha breakfast and come. Come on, go.
[848.64] Don’t worry, I am here.
[852.96] After all I am her only aunt.
[855.16] Yes?
[866.24] God, thank you so much my Lord.
[868.84] Everything went fine.
[870.92] Just wait till the evening,
[873.48] then you can see your little angel.
[876.92] Hey, I will bring breakfast.
[912.76] What are you doing? It is a hospital, 
be a little careful.
[916.04] You don’t see the place in love
[919.44] You don’t defame your lover in love like this in public.
[923.20] Can I ask you something?
[925.16] If I get jealous of your love with your daughter,
 then? What will you do?
[957.40] She is really pretty.
[960.40] And she takes up after you.
[962.64] Who else will she take up after, 
apart from her handsome father.
[968.24] When will I be able to see my daughter, 
Shaheer.
[972.80] I cannot wait anymore.
[975.60] What are the doctors saying?
[977.32] She is absolutely alright.
[979.24] Just wait for two to three days,
[981.60] after that no one can separate her from you.
[989.00] What name did you think of?
[992.12] Fatima.
[994.48] Fatima?
[996.00] This is a really pretty name.
[1000.36] Excuse me.
[1002.68] Yes, Mr. Ashfaq?
[1004.84] Really? Wow.
[1006.60] That’s great news.
[1008.44] Congratulations.
[1010.04] All this is possible because of your hard work.
[1012.44] I will see you in the office.
[1014.40] Again, great news. Great news. Good job.
 Thank you.
[1019.72] What is the matter? You are really happy.
[1022.00] This is great.
[1023.00] My daughter is really lucky for me.
[1025.52] There was a deal, we were after for a long time. 
Just got it.
[1029.08] Thank you Irha.
[1030.44] Thank you so much for everything.
[1032.80] Thank you, Shaheer.
[1054.48] Hmmm…
[1056.96] Shaheer, please ask the driver to drop me
and mama dropped home.
[1061.88] Why do you need the driver? 
I will drop you myself.
[1064.96] Please stay. I am alone here anyway, Sajjal.
[1069.36] Irha I feel feverish,
[1071.52] I have a headache too.
[1073.32] I want to go home and rest for a while.
[1076.24] After all, brother Shakur is unable to take care of the home,
 till I don’t stay on his head.
[1081.44] I will do one thing, I will leave mama with you. 
What do you say, Shaheer?
[1086.16] Yes, that is right. I will ask aunty…
No, Shaheer.
[1089.52] She will worry for no reason, please,
[1091.80] there is no reason to leave her here.
[1093.96] I will be back in an hour.
[1096.04] Don’t worry. Okay?
[1097.88] You please stay here.
[1099.84] Irha, I will come and go in a flash.
[1103.56] Come on.
[1170.16] Oh wow, Shaheer you did all this?
[1176.04] This is nothing to welcome my daughter.
[1178.48] You will see what I do in future.
[1180.72] Such big surprises as soon as your daughter came.
[1184.84] See, how pretty she looks while sleeping.
[1187.84] How cute.
[1239.08] Sajjal, 
Leghari industries has thrown a party in the evening.
[1242.96] Irha cannot come with me,
 I was thinking you come with me.
[1246.32] So be ready?
[1248.16] How can I go with you with mama around, 
Shaheer?
[1251.20] Make an excuse, it is nothing big for you.
[1256.20] You have no idea how typical mama is.
[1259.16] She will never let me go, she will say no.
[1261.60] Come on Sajjal,
[1263.44] these things of helplessness sound 
weird coming from you.
[1269.84] That is why I say,
[1271.36] do something soon, 
so that these helplessness ends.
[1276.00] Hmmm. Okay.
[1279.16] Then I will tell Irha to get ready,
[1281.36] because you said no.
[1284.44] When did I say no?
[1286.24] If you didn’t say no, then be ready.
 I will not take any excuses.
[1290.16] Yes, but how will I convince her?
[1292.88] That is something you need to think about.
[1294.64] Just be ready in the evening and 
nothing should be lacking.
[1297.52] Okay. Bye.
[1300.48] Okay, bye.
[1328.20] If I don’t go along, Irha will go.
[1332.16] Now I will have to do something to stop Irha.
[1359.52] she is really pretty. Right,
[1363.80] Irha child? Live long.
[1367.04] Hey, she doesn’t bother you, right Irha?
[1369.28] She bothers me a lot.
[1370.92] She cries all night long. Often Shaheer comes to ask me, 
why I am making his daughter cry.
[1377.00] Don’t bother our princess,
[1381.96] What did you name her?
[1384.56] Shaheer wants to name her Fatima.
[1388.16] Now what objection can I have on Shaheer’s choice.
[1392.40] Fatima? it is a really good name.
[1396.72] it is a blessed name. May God give her life,
[1400.12] may He show her happiness with health.
[1404.84] Greetings papa, when did you come?
[1407.24] Child, I have been here for long.
[1409.24] Okay. Where were you?
[1410.76] You should be here with Irha and your mother.
[1414.92] Papa, I was in the kitchen.
[1416.80] Mama takes care of Fatima all day long,
[1419.12] so I have to take care of Fatima.
[1421.32] That’s why.
[1424.00] Now once Irha gets fine,
[1426.52] you pack your bag and come home. 
You have lived here for so long.
[1433.36] Oh my lovely child…She is so good, 
she is so pretty. A lot.
[1437.24] She takes up after Shaheer.
[1438.92] No. No. See,
[1440.20] she has delicate features like Irha. 
Huh?
[1445.76] Sajjal,
[1446.84] you do one thing, pack my bag quickly.
[1450.04] I will go home with your father.
[1451.72] Your uncle Aslam is really unwell, 
he is in the hospital.
[1455.44] Why? What happened to uncle?
[1457.28] Hey, he had a heartattack and 
we will go straight to the hospital from here.
[1461.60] The doctor has suggested a surgery to him,
 right?
[1464.60] Yes. Yes, you don’t worry at all about Irha.
 I will take care of Irha
[1469.00] and I will also take care of Fatima as well.
[1471.60] Okay? Fine. 
You people go and check on uncle.
[1474.32] He really needs you people.
[1476.60] You people don’t worry, 
we will manage everything ourselves.
[1480.76] In fact, if you need anything, 
then I will ask Shaheer to do that as well.
[1485.00] Hey, no child, we don’t need anything.
[1487.40] You just take care of yourself and the princess.
[1491.28] Should I help you with the packing mama? 
Go. Come on.
[1497.04] She has gone to sleep, Irha.
[1500.40] She has gone to sleep. Oh, hey. Oh God.
[1514.04] You were saying it is really hard for you to come,
[1516.40] or do you enjoy me being restless?
[1520.56] Maybe fate also helps those who love.
[1524.16] That is why all paths get cleared as well.
[1527.84] Didn’t aunt ask you?
[1530.44] She has left, 
and she wont even come for a few days.
[1534.04] Oh,
[1535.60] so we are free from the chains of the cruel world.
[1538.20] We can live freely now.
[1541.36] Exactly.
[1543.72] Good.
[1784.68] What is this noise at 2 am?
[1788.32] You haven’t slept till now, Irha?
[1791.92] I was sleeping, I woke up by your noise,
[1794.48] and it is good I woke up.
[1797.48] You shouldn’t stand up for so long,
[1800.56] come I will drop you to your room…
you don’t need to care for me.
[1803.64] If you were so caring towards me, 
then you should have been with me and my daughter.
[1807.32] You wouldn’t be laughing here like this at 2 am 
with your brother in law.
[1810.56] You are getting upset for no reason.
[1812.28] I stopped her actually.
[1814.16] I am not getting upset, Shaheer.
[1816.04] Where were you since evening?
[1817.80] Did you even come to check on me, once?
[1820.68] Irha, actually a friend of mine called.
[1823.92] I had to go to meet her. 
I totally forget to tell you.
[1834.20] You surprise me, Sajjal.
[1835.80] She was so worried,
 you should have at least sent a message.
[1838.52] Yes, I made a mistake.
[1840.60] I am so sorry, Irha.
[1844.28] Sajjal,
[1847.12] where is the earring from one of your ears?
[1856.92] I forgot it in the room.
[1921.64] Today Fatima will meet her father.
[1924.24] She will surprise her father.
[1926.48] She will give him a lot of love.
[1928.56] Everything has changed so much, right?
[1930.68] It feels like we are not going to his room after months,
[1932.96] but after generations to his room.
[1936.32] Yes, madam, did you call me?
[1938.16] Yes, get all my clothes shifted to my room.
[1940.80] We will live there from today.
[1943.68] And Fatima will live with her father. 
Now Fatima has come in our life.
[1949.08] Papa will love Fatima a lot, right?
[1952.80] My Fatima. My life. See, papa’s room is here.
[2008.72] You surprise me, Sajjal. She was so worried, 
you should have at least sent a message.
[2012.92] Yes, I made a mistake. I am so sorry, Irha.
[2018.68] Sajjal,
[2021.52] where is the earring from one of your ears?
[2031.44] I forgot it in the room.
[2040.68] Brother Shakur,
[2042.96] this belongs to Sajjal.
[2045.52] What?
[2049.92] Brother Shakur,
[2054.00] does this belong to Sajjal?
[2060.04] That is why I told you
 to send your sister to her home.
[2073.24] She is trying to take your place.
[2079.52] How long has this been going on for?
[2082.80] Since you have fallen ill, since then.
[2091.60] Why didn’t you tell me all this earlier, 
brother Shakur?
[2097.24] Madam Irha, it was not my place.
[2102.24] The situation has gone out of your thinking.
[2112.24] Sabira has caught those two red handed, 
several times.
[2120.20] That is why madam Sajjal turned against Sabira.
[2125.40] And not just this,
[2127.12] but I am completely sure that
[2131.72] madam Sajjal 
got Sabira jailed in a false allegation of theft.
[2143.16] Madam Irha, she scared me a lot, 
she threatened me.
[2153.76] The truth is that I got scared
[2161.68] because
[2163.84] Mr. Shaheer sees with madam Sajjal’s eyes 
and listens through her ears.
[2169.92] And madam Sajjal goes around 
Mr. Shaheer all the time.
