Irha, what happened, child? I am thanking my God, aunt. His blessings are so vast, that blesses a person before 
he falls in the quicksand of failure. That is all fine, but tell me what happened? I got a job, 
and I also got a really good package. They have also allotted a home along with it. Really? Thank God. Congratulations to you. Your hard work has paid off, child. All this is a result of your prayers, or else I had given up. You will see that I will pray for you day and night, and you will progress a lot. Come let’s bow down in front of God 
and thank Him. God, it is a favour You did on us. Thank God. It is a big French fry, my love eat it. Eat it. Listen, go to the car and bring her milk. Yummy. Yummy. Why are you not eating? If you don’t like it, then order something else. No, I am not in the mood. What is the need to spoil your mood 
on something so small? Something small? What are you ruined? You have ruined all my clothes. You have no manners in you. All my clothes are ruined, 
my clothes are soaked in oil, and you are asking me 
why I have a bad mood. Whatever it is. You don’t like this with a young child. Such an expensive suit 
of mine has all the oil of the French fries on it, and you are saying I shouldn’t talk like this. I bought it for you, right? You didn’t buy it with your own pocket that 
you are feeling so much pain. Now you will also taunt me 
with the things you bought? I am just saying that 
we will get more clothes, you fix your behaviour towards her. Why? Should we not teach the 
difference between right and wrong? Should we not make her understand? There is a big difference between 
explaining with love and scolding, which I think is something you are forgetting. That is why I had told you not to bring her, but you are always interested in taking her 
along everywhere, all the time. You know what? You are right. We shouldn’t have come here. Let’s go home. Come on, child. Come. Come. Come. Sajjal. Sajjal, I am going for breakfast. Come on, come have breakfast with me. I am sleepy. Please, let me sleep. Come on, I am getting late for work. 
Please, come. Sajjal. Sajjal. Come on. What is it?
 If you are getting late then what can I do? I am not your maid that I stand in front of you
 early in the morning, to do your work. Let me sleep, I am sleepy. How are you talking to me? I told you, let me sleep. I am sleepy. Hello. Are you upset? Why? Shouldn’t I be? The way you insulted me last night, 
that too on something small. I just wanted to say that 
you don’t talk to such a small child like this. So I take care of her all day long, if I scolded her a little, 
do I not even have this much right? You proved that I am nothing to her. I didn’t mean that. Anyway, I am sorry. I shouldn’t have spoken to you like that. If you are tired of me, then tell me. 
I will make some arrangements for me. I am not Irha that 
I will tolerate this behaviour of yours. This will not happen again, I promise. But you don’t talk about leaving on everything. I cannot tolerate it. Tell me, why did you call? We have to go to a party in the evening, be ready. Whose party? The party of the owner of the 
Sultan Group of Companies. Our company wants to buy 
some shares from them. If this collaboration is done, we will win the lottery. I have tried to finalize the deal, we have to go for that. I want that nothing goes wrong. Okay fine, I will be ready. Okay. Listen, I love you. Hey, miss Irha you have still not gone home? Yes, madam a little work was left, I thought I would finish the work once and go. Our client left really happy from here. In fact, 
the way you have worked hard in the past few days, because of which our company has benefited a lot. Madam, I am just completing my tasks with 
full hard work and honesty. Nothing else. This is a big success for you. Thank you madam. What happened? 
You didn’t shift to your new home. Is there a problem? If there is, then please share it. Actually, I have a lot of memories with that home. Aunt also lives there, so that is why madam I was delaying it a little, 
nothing else. I see, as you wish. I too will see what you will be able to achieve, 
once Shaheer Ahmad’s label is removed from you. Shaheer, please… You still have time. If you love your child so much then 
quietly live with respect in this home. Shaheer, you were wrong. I had a recognition before meeting you 
and that is still there. Your companionship did 
show me a few bright days, but it also gave me a permanent sea of sorrows. But no sorrow you gave me, wasn’t able to make a deal on 
my self-respect and position. Brother, take a U-turn and stop at that shop. Greetings. Greetings madam. How are you? You visited after really long. I am fine. Is someone at home? No one is there. Mr. Shaheer and madam Sajjal went to a party, they will come late at night. and my daughter Fatima? She is at home. If you want to meet her, 
then go ahead. No one will find out anything. Thank you so much brother Karamdad. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, who are you? I am Fatima’s mother. Can you give me five minutes with her,
 alone? Yes, sure. Fatima, your mama has come. Happy birthday my love. Look, mama got a gift for you. Your mama came to wish you on your birthday. May God give you all the happiness of the world. May you never face any worry or pain. Your mama really loves you a lot. She really misses you. She is a little distant from you, but she always loves her 
Fatima even being away from her. You never be upset with your mother, don’t be misled about her. She is helpless, that is why she is far from you. Even being away from you, 
she wants to be with you all the time, Fatima. Mama loves you. Happy birthday. Shaheer, welcome. I am so glad to see you.
 It felt good that you came. Pleasure is all mine. After all, it is a lifelong partnership now. Along with business, 
I have also been really impressed with your courtesy. Thank you. Thank you. You have made the party lively by coming to it. Thank you. Thank you. How could I not come? 
You called me with so much love. You didn’t introduce her. Oh, Sultan, this is Sajjal, my girlfriend. Sajjal, Sultan. The tycoon of the chemical industry. Nowadays his name is famous
 in the stock market. You praised me a lot. Anyway, Sajjal, it is really nice to meet you. It felt good to meet you. Nice to meet you too. By the way he never praises you, but nowadays he really praises you. Why? Has he never praised you either? You know. you don’t need to be praised. Anyway, enjoy your drinks. Sure. and enjoy the party, 
I will see you guys in a while. Yeah, sure. Shaheer, why did you tell Sultan Khan that 
I am your girlfriend? Because everyone over here 
knows Irha is my wife, so… Excuse me. Hi Shaheer, how are you? Good to see you. I had told you I will meet you 
some day and now see. It felt good seeing you here. If you are free someday, 
let’s have lunch together. You know I cannot say no to you. But not today. Today I am Sultan Khan’s guest, I know, the world praises the rising sun. You are the same too. You saw a slight fair complexion and features, you forgot your wife’s faithfulness and
 fell for your sister in law? I will see you around. I noticed you didn’t eat anything, 
should I bring something for you. No. Thank you. I will take something myself. It felt good to meet you. I do hope we meet again. Why are you embarrassing me? You are really intelligent, and beautiful too. Shaheer had to lose his heart seeing you. Anyway, what keeps you busy nowadays, 
apart from being Shaheer’s girlfriend? What? Why don’t you partner up 
with Shaheer in the business? Shaheer doesn’t like it. Hi is really smart, he knows when to use whom. 
He is very sharp. Will you have coffee with me? Sure. Whenever Shaheer is free, 
we will make a plan. Not with Shaheer. I want to meet you alone. I am surprised that Shaheer has a girl like you locked up
 in the four walls of the home. You are the one whom every eye in the 
world should praise. You probably don’t know what your worth is. I didn’t understand what you said. You will when the time comes. But I am hoping to see you again. Your stars are really shining bright or else you would never be 
able to win from me in chess. My luck has always been good. Even if I touch sand it turns to gold. It was different earlier. The whole city used to praise Shaheer Ahmad, but he too seems restless to 
do a partnership with you. What magic have you done that 
he is sitting in your feet? Just think that it took hard work 
of a lot of years to bring Shaheer to this point. He was really arrogant. He had the passion to be number one. He didn’t let anyone progress. But now I will ruin him in a way that he too wouldn’t be able to find
 out whose hand is behind him being ruined. Sultan Khan, it is not that easy to defeat Shaheer Ahmad. This is all things of the past. Now the situation of Shaheer’s home and business are really fragile. Now he cannot save himself even if he wants to. Sultan. Sajjal, listen to me as well. What is left to listen to? You have insulted me calling me your girlfriend. So I will call you what you are. So why don’t you give this relationship a name? Why have you kept it without a name? You know it is not possible for me. Then I too don’t need to go 
with you anywhere in future. I am tired of this daily insult. Do you have 
any idea how people were looking at me? I felt disgusted on myself. You are blowing things 
out of proportions for no reason. Has she gone to sleep? Yes, madam. What is all this? Who brought it? Madam, madam Irha brought all this. Irha brought it? How dare she come to this home, and how did you let her come inside the home? No. No, madam, she didn’t come in the home. She gave all this on the doorstep and went. So why did you take all this,
 why did you not throw it in her face? What is the matter? 
Why are you getting so upset? Did you see how much courage this woman had. See this, what has she brought? How dare she come to this home? What does she want to prove that 
she loves her daughter? Huh? Irha came here? Yes, sir. I am telling you I cannot tolerate all this. You tell her that she cannot come to this home. If she steps in this home,
 I will push her out of here. And you. You too listen to me carefully, in future she cannot even step in this home. Sure. Come on, Sajjal, she is her mother, she can come meet her when she wants. If she was the mother, 
then why did she leave her and go? She should have taken her along. 
What does she want to prove? You are overreacting for no reason. Don’t forget it was my decision to drag her out
and keep Fatima here. Why are you sympathizing with her so much? What do you want to say?
Do you want to call her back? You are saying something wrong. The truth is always bitter. And you, pick up all this and throw it out. Nothing will go anywhere. Her mother brought it. She has a right to keep these things with her. What are you saying, Shaheer? You are favouring the woman…
I am not favouring anyone, I am just trying to make you understand…
I don’t want to hear or understand anything. That woman cannot come to this home. I have said it, that’s it. Sit down. That’s fantastic news. Great. Fix me a meeting with Sultan. That is fine, sir, but think about it once more. Should we buy their shares like this, suddenly? Why shouldn’t we buy them? If we buy the shares at a low price, 
and sell them at a high price, that’s how we will recover our losses. You are right, sir. But I think we should have waited a little. Sultan group of companies 
doesn’t have an impressive past record, sir. Look, it was different earlier, but right now their company’s standing is really good. All the businessmen are willing to buy his shares. And we are lucky that 
he giving us this opportunity himself. I just want to say, sir. We have nothing in backup. What if we have to face a big loss. We would have to take a risk, Noman, and this is not the first time, 
we have always been doing that. The company’s condition has 
not been like this ever again, sir. That’s is why I am taking a risk. I want good days for the company to return again. For that it is necessary to have this deal finalized. So get the meeting fixed. Sir, Miss Irha’s property documents are ready, what do we do about that? I have spoken to the lawyer about that, 
he will look into it. You focus on the meeting. I want it done. Okay. Last night for the first time in my life,
 I was proud of Shaheer Ahmad. What was that for? That damned has some great luck. He has got the companionship of a best 
of girls every time. But this time something amazing has happened, 
she is not a girl, she is a magic. A magic. No matter how much magic she can cast, whenever Shaheer Ahmad sees a prettier face, he will move towards her. He is not faithful to anyone. With such a girl, 
who will be the sinner who can even look at another girl? Because he only has one drug, and to get it, he can put everything he has on the line. It is possible, 
but this time the girl he got is something different. We will see, if something different will happen this time or will history repeat itself? Fine, if that’s how it is, 
then I will also try playing. Hello. Hello. Who is it? I am Sultan. Where did you get my number from? You even find God when you search, and I have found you, 
the number is something ordinary. Why did you call? My wish to have coffee with 
you has not been fulfilled till now. I still haven’t spoken to Shaheer. So he has you imprisoned that 
you cannot go anywhere without his will. Very sad. There is nothing like that. 
I…There shouldn’t be anything like that. You are not his wife that
 he can boss you around. You are smart, you are beautiful, you shouldn’t put yourself in useless restrictions. You have not been made to be locked in home, in fact, you are the diamond that every eye should praise. So are you coming? For what? I want to discuss something. I have a really good opportunity for you. Where do you want to meet? I will send you the location. We will meet tomorrow. Take care. Should I go or not? I should go, yes. Shaheer’s behaviour is changing 
with me day by day. At least I should find out
the proposal Sultan has for me. Hey Sajjal, how are you? Greetings.  Greetings. We could have met somewhere outside, 
why did you call me here? It was not suitable to meet outside, 
if someone had seen us, then what would you have told Shaheer? And I only invite special people to my home. Really? Since when did I become special for you? Since I saw you, I met you. Once Sultan Khan looks at someone then that 
person doesn’t stay ordinary. Impressive. Please. Please have a seat. Thank you. You are impressive Sajjal. I was looking for such a bold and confident girl. You know I was really worried before coming here. I was thinking if I should meet you or not? Oh come on, now you are not a sixteen
 year old girl that you worry so much. and after all, I called you here for your benefit. You are in the company of Sultan Khan. So please, just relax. Well, coming here I see some benefit.
 I like it here now. I knew you would know 
your importance by coming here. Something Shaheer 
has never been able to give you. So was the objective of this meeting as to meet me? Sultan Khan can do anything to make a
 beautiful girl like you his partner. Partners? Yes. Now we will become business partners. This was the objective of this meeting. Since I have met you, I have been thinking the same thing, 
that what you saw in a man like Shaheer Ahmed. I mean you could have got the best of men, then why your married brother in law? This is a personal matter of mine,
 I…Come on, buddy. We will now be business partners, what is the secrets that you are keeping. After all, I am not used to any formalities in relations. How do you know
 what relation I have with Shaheer? The whole business community knows, 
in fact, people also say that since Shaheer left his wife, he has to face loss after loss. Maybe he got his wife’s curse. There is nothing like that. Those two didn’t have an understanding, that’s it. Oh so this is what he saying and fooling you. I didn’t understand what you were saying. Sir, food is ready. Fine, you go. Please. What I meant to say was that 
you are a really decent and naïve girl. You don’t know what your worth is, Sajjal. That is why Shaheer Ahmad is taking advantage of you, 
he is fooling you. He loves me, how can he take advantage of me? Hah, love. Shaheer just knows how to do business, he doesn’t know anything about love. The man who cannot take care 
of the mother of his daughter, how can he love? Why don’t you say it clearly? What do you want to say? Have a seat. Come. Thank you. Just think. Think about yourself. Shaheer will be bankrupt really soon. At most he has two to three days to survive. That is why he is trying to buy 
my business shares. That is why we will be business partners. We should be business partners. Why are you not talking to me clearly? Tell me. Excuse me. Mr. Jameel, I am in a very important meeting. 
Say what you have to quickly. It cannot be less than five hundred million. Yes, I have no objections. Why don’t you set up my meeting with them 
and let me know. Okay? Goodbye. Sorry about that. You are such a big businessman, you could have invested with anyone. We are those make two plus two into eight. We are serving people. God is blessing us, we are distributing it. So will you invest with me? You know, I don’t have that much money, but… You don’t need to invest. You just have to be my partner, that’s it. I need some time to think. Don’t worry. You will pray for me all your life. So can I take the papers and go home? Of course, you have all the time in the world. But you will only benefit partnering with me. Oh wow. Please start eating. Please. Yes, sure. Thank you. This is a small gift from me for you. What is this? This is to our friendship. When you wear it, its worth will increase. No. No. I cannot take this at all. Please, I want you to have it. I want that you keep my word. After all, they say that 
giving gifts increases love and friendship. Thank you. I am starting to feel proud of your friendship. Now you are going to be Sultan Khan 
and not Shaheer Ahmad’s partner. So you need to be proud. After all, that man never considered you 
capable to be his partner. Thank you so much for doing all this. I am doing all this for myself too. How is that? I have some old accounts to settle
 with Shaheer Ahmad. So you want to use me? Do you feel that? Even if you want to, 
then everyone here is looking for their benefit. If I too will benefit,
then we will surely meet again. Where is sir? Sir is on the dining table. Okay. Hi Sultan. Hi Zoya. How are you? How are you? Who are you? She is my friend. Why don’t you tell her honestly. I am Shaheer’s ex-girlfriend. Who at one time
 he would lay his life for just like you. What? All this is a lie. This is not a lie. This is the reality that neither you, nor his wife Irha knows. But seeing you I immediately understood that every beautiful girl is his weakness. What do you want to say? I came to tell you some facts, through which the eyes of a stupid girl like you 
would open. What facts? The things Shaheer hid from you. What nonsense is this? Shaheer loves me truly. Why are you misleading me? Huh? Do you want to take some revenge from him? What did he do to you? You are really naïve, or else you would never broke your sister’s home. He had claimed to have loved me
 just like you at a time. But neither did he marry me, and nor was he faithful to me. He married a faithful girl like Irha, but he couldn’t be faithful. So you…you came to take revenge. So that I listen to you and leave Shaheer, right? I only came to say something after I got ruined. Get a grip. The bird that likes going to every branch, he can never be faithful. This will never happen. Shaheer has promised me. He has unfaithfulness in his nature. 
Who do you have hopes from? Anyway, my responsibility was to tell you, rest is up to you. Because now if Shaheer finds out about me, then I have no fear of him. Listen, can you stay for some time. Can you tell me something more about Shaheer? I can tell you so much that 
even Shaheer Ahmad doesn’t know about himself.
