[26.96] My child, I know your sorrow is really big.
[31.28] Get a grip on yourself.
[33.92] Shaheer is really damned that 
he couldn’t care for you.
[40.92] I am not sad about this divorce, aunt.
[47.36] This had to happen one day.
[55.04] But Shaheer didn’t have a little 
mercy for a mother in his heart.
[59.44] He has become so cruel.
[63.52] Did you go to meet, Fatima?
[67.60] When my heart becomes really restless,
[70.36] when I am unable to control myself, 
then I secretly go to meet her.
[75.72] Okay, you don’t cry.
[80.44] You will see, everything will be fine.
[82.88] God will soften his heart, 
then no one can stop you from meeting your daughter.
[89.16] I don’t want anything from him, aunt.
[92.72] He should just let me meet Fatima, sometimes.
[98.88] Then I will gradually 
get in the habit of living without her.
[102.84] But right now, I am unable to control myself.
[109.28] I cannot live without meeting her, aunt.
[114.28] Okay,
[115.48] stop crying, child.
[118.52] Pray to God.
[121.96] Because we cannot have 
any hopes from humans.
[125.40] He is the only One who will listen to our prayer.
[129.72] You have faced so many sorrows in your life,
child.
[133.48] Another one.
[136.80] Everything will be fine.
[141.72] Just don’t cry.
[163.60] Good evening, sweetheart.
[169.16] What is the matter?
[170.56] Is everything okay?
[171.76] Why are you looking at me like that?
[175.80] Nothing.
[177.84] Did the deal get finalized?
[179.92] Well, the progress is good,
[181.44] it will get final.
[183.40] You didn’t tell me you
 are facing so much loss in business.
[191.84] There is up and down in business.
[195.60] Still, you should have told me,
[198.20] I am your business partner.
[200.60] If you hide things from me, how would I feel?
[209.08] I just don’t want to worry you.
[211.36] There is nothing else.
[214.92] What about Irha’s property?
[218.16] I have divorced her,
[219.76] that is why 
I am not taking back the property from her.
[224.20] Why?
[227.04] I am not in the habit to take something back 
from someone after I have given it.
[232.20] Don’t make a losing deal in this greatness of yours.
[236.32] I have heard that 
your markets are falling quickly in the market.
[240.04] If you are with me,
[242.44] then I don’t fear any loss.
[246.00] Just don’t let your love be reduced,
[248.60] I will stand against each storm in the world.
[252.32] You couldn’t even give me your name,
[254.36] what else can I expect from you?
[258.04] Once this deal is finalized,
[259.56] I promise you we will get married after this.
[262.52] Come on, cheer up.
[264.12] I have divorced her.
[266.44] You divorced her after so long.
[268.88] Sajjal.
[343.28] Hello.
[344.32] Where do I have to come?
[354.48] Sajjal.
[357.32] Sajjal.
[360.76] Greetings sir.
[362.84] Where is madam Sajjal?
[364.04] Madam Sajjal is not at home.
[366.16] Where did she go?
[367.24] She didn’t tell me before leaving,
[368.68] but she often goes out after you leave.
[374.52] Then who takes care of Fatima?
[376.44] I have madam Fatima with me. But sir,
[379.40] you don’t say anything to her, she will get upset.
[401.56] What do I ask her waking her up?
[405.60] Things will get out of hands for no reason.
[409.72] But Sajjal is becoming negligent towards Fatima.
[416.68] Staying out of the home for so long,
[420.48] leaving Fatima on the maid and going.
[423.64] How long has this been going on for?
[425.44] And how long will it go on for?
[429.04] I will have to talk to her.
[463.76] Oh wow.
[466.16] Shaheer, you did all this?
[470.04] This is nothing to welcome my daughter.
[472.44] You see what I do for her in the future.
[474.76] Such big surprises on your daughter’s arrival.
[477.24] My love…Fatima is so good, she is so pretty. 
Really pretty.
[481.24] She takes up after Shaheer.
[482.64] No. No. Her features are delicate like Irha. 
Yes?
[496.52] Oh God,
[499.92] give me patience and peace.
[505.32] The separation from 
my daughter makes me suffer, God.
[510.88] Give me peace
[516.52] and keep my daughter in your protection.
[522.16] We in our fight for relations,
[525.84] lose innocent children.
[529.60] At times, mother, at times, father.
[534.28] Fighting with each other,
[537.04] we torment our children.
[541.96] And those flowers that 
need to be brought up with love,
[546.84] start getting ignored in our hatred,
[550.28] they begin to wither.
[571.88] Oh God,
[574.60] you keep my daughter safe.
[580.44] May the heat of the differences between me 
and Shaheer never fall on her.
[589.36] Keep her in Your protection, God.
[594.28] We are not capable of facing Your challenges,
[598.48] we couldn’t even take care of the 
blessing You gave us.
[604.52] But You help me.
[647.96] Shaheer has gifted you
 a really valuable property.
[653.52] But it is not worth more 
than the time you gave him.
[661.76] I just have all this.
[664.48] Think that I am playing a gamble.
[668.64] God knows why I want to trust you.
[673.20] Why don’t you leave him?
[678.08] I will take you to the heights of success.
[684.16] You will have more money and wealth than this.
[688.08] How is this possible? Shaheer really loves me.
[690.96] He doesn’t love you.
[693.32] If he did, he would have married you till now.
[699.36] After all, he is a player,
[701.64] he wouldn’t want to be trapped by anyone.
[705.24] Well, leaving him or not leaving him is up to you.
[710.84] He is just waiting for the deal with you to happen, 
after that we will get married.
[716.80] Fine, I will believe you if you say so.
[719.88] But according to his past records,
[722.68] he is only passing his time with you,
[728.56] and you have already
 become his daughter’s governess.
[736.32] You don’t deserve this, Sajjal.
[738.88] But anyway,
[740.88] my business deal has nothing
 to do with his personal life.
[747.20] Rest, you are smart.
[754.12] I am getting late. I will leave.
[766.60] Sajjal,
[772.08] at times what you see is not the truth.
[813.40] I will take you to the heights of success.
[816.88] You will have more money and wealth than this.
[820.48] How is this possible? 
Shaheer really loves me.
[824.04] He doesn’t love you.
[826.40] If he did,
[828.00] he would have married you till now.
[832.48] After all, he is a player,
[834.84] he wouldn’t want to be trapped by anyone.
[838.36] Well, leaving him or not leaving him is up to you.
[846.16] He is just waiting for the deal with you to happen,
[848.80] after that we will get married.
[850.88] Fine, I will believe you if you say so.
[853.84] But according to his past records,
[856.64] he is only passing his time with you,
[862.44] and you have already 
become his daughter’s governess.
[870.36] You don’t deserve this, Sajjal.
[875.32] What Sultan is saying has weightage.
[878.28] The one who gifted me such a big diamond set 
on our first meeting,
[883.48] and Shaheer couldn’t give me anything 
other than consolation and hopes.
[889.08] I have become a joke.
[891.52] Or the governess of his daughter.
[912.28] You came back soon.
[914.20] Where are you coming from?
[916.64] I went to the mall.
[919.24] So dressed up?
[921.96] Did you go the mall yesterday too?
[923.80] What is there to be surprised in this?
[926.60] I get ready for you too every day.
[928.36] If you dress up for me, then have you 
found another Shaheer Ahmad in my absence?
[932.72] What do you mean?
[935.60] Do you have no shame that 
you are putting such a cheap allegation on me?
[939.32] I am asking.
[941.40] If it is not true, then deny it.
[945.24] But your anger tells me that maybe I am right. 
That maybe I am right.
[948.60] You know, what?
[950.00] You are disgusting.
[977.56] He is just waiting for the deal 
with you to happen,
[980.04] after that we will get married.
[983.40] Fine, I will believe you if you say so.
[986.52] But according to his past records,
[989.28] he is only passing his time with you,
[1008.92] I am sorry, I said too much in my anger.
[1264.16] Thank God your mourning 
days have passed safely.
[1270.12] I even got a call from the office.
[1272.24] They are asking me to join from tomorrow.
[1274.76] That is good child.
[1277.16] Go safely.
[1278.60] May God bless you and what you earn.
[1283.56] After all, child, when a person starts working,
[1286.72] they forget a hundred sorrows.
[1289.84] But aunt these sorrows are such that 
maybe I will not be able to forget all my life.
[1295.76] At times, I feel that maybe
[1298.40] there was something lacking in my faithfulness that
[1301.20] Shaheer did all this with me.
[1305.32] No Irha,
[1307.64] you don’t lack anything, child.
[1312.44] You are a courageous, strong and faithful girl.
[1318.48] It is Shaheer who is unlucky,
[1320.52] who didn’t know the worth of a diamond like you.
[1323.40] Aunt, I don’t know if I am a diamond or not,
[1328.32] or else he would not have put such a bad 
stain on me for the rest of my life.
[1336.36] There is no stain on your life.
[1339.96] The bad stain is my daughter Sajjal,
[1343.48] who has ruined a happy and settled life.
[1350.40] I will never forgive her.
[1355.32] You are a mother.
[1358.40] Forgive her like a mother.
[1363.04] You forgive with your heart,
[1366.72] and my heart is not clean towards Sajjal, child.
[1371.68] You will see, child,
[1373.52] one day Shaheer and Sajjal will regret.
[1379.04] Right now they are blindfolded by the shimmer,
[1385.56] the day this blindfold is removed from the eyes,
[1389.80] that day they would feel each 
other’s existence for themselves as worthless.
[1393.76] It will feel like dust.
[1397.64] And I am waiting for that day.
[1401.04] I am waiting for the day
[1403.92] and you will also see that
[1407.60] unfaithfulness is only met with unfaithfulness, 
child.
[1411.20] But I have nothing left for my entire life, 
but patience.
[1417.52] No, child,
[1419.60] you have courage,
[1421.68] the strength, you have the capability
[1425.80] and your future is really bright, child.
[1429.56] Your honesty and goodness will take you far.
[1435.56] You will always be successful in life, child.
[1441.88] My prayers are with you.
[1456.48] Greetings sir, your breakfast is ready.
[1458.84] Where is madam Fatima?
[1460.32] I put madam to sleep with difficulty.
[1463.80] Why?
[1464.56] She had fever all night,
[1466.24] I kept cold compress and the fever went down. 
Now she is sleeping.
[1469.92] If she had such high fever,
 then why did you not tell me?
[1472.08] Sir, we had told madam,
[1475.36] she told us to give her medication and
 put her to sleep.
[1477.60] She also told us not to tell you so that
[1479.88] you don’t worry.
[1481.96] She has lost her mind.
[1484.28] If something like this happens again,
 tell me directly.
[1487.16] Yes, sure.
[1492.04] Right now she doesn’t have fever,
[1494.36] Right now, she doesn’t have fever,
[1497.80] I too will try to come back soon.
[1500.64] But if there is any issue, 
then call me immediately.
[1503.12] Sure, sir.
[1527.36] Hello.
[1530.12] Yes. I was sleeping.
[1536.52] That’s great news.
[1541.44] Okay, I will come over.
[1543.80] Don’t worry.
[1552.16] No one can stop me from 
becoming a business woman.
[1555.76] Thank you so much, Sultan.
[1576.56] Madam, Sajjal.
[1577.76] Yes? Madam Fatima’s fever is really high.
[1581.24] Oh, did you not give her medication at night?
[1584.12] I gave her medication. 
The fever goes down and then increases.
[1587.28] It is really necessary to take her to the doctor.
[1589.04] Even sir said this and went.
[1591.88] Yes, so what was your sir saying?
[1594.40] Tell madam Sajjal to take madam Fatima 
to the doctor,
[1597.68] I too will come early.
[1600.04] Then why doesn’t your sir take his daughter?
[1602.48] Is it all my responsibility.
[1604.76] Madam, what should I do?
[1607.72] I told you, take care of her. 
Put cold compress.
[1610.52] The fever is really high, 
it is not even going down with cold compress.
[1613.48] I told you, it is important for me to go. 
Manage it.
[1616.40] I will take her when I come back.
[1618.48] But this way sir will get further upset.
[1620.80] So you don’t spy on me for sir.
[1623.48] I will come back and fulfil my duty.
[1626.20] This child has made my life hell.
[1651.60] What happened? You don’t look fine.
[1655.64] I don’t know why my heart is worried.
[1658.28] Do you mind
[1659.72] if I excuse myself from this presentation?
[1661.68] No, you go home.
[1662.96] This is the result of working day and night.
[1665.24] Thank you, madam.
[1700.56] The diamonds look beautiful on you.
[1702.92] Thank you for wearing then.
[1704.84] Thank you for giving me such beautiful 
and expensive diamonds.
[1709.60] This is the start of our friendship
[1712.08] and this is just an ordinary gift.
[1715.44] I will be really happy once you
 become a successful businesswoman.
[1720.72] We are business partners, right?
[1723.68] Yes, definitely.
[1726.36] And since your steps have joined mine,
[1728.88] I have only had benefit.
[1730.60] This is a positive sign.
[1732.16] I have taken the right decision at the right time.
[1735.04] Thank you to you.
[1736.24] You are welcome.
[1738.08] I have opened your bank account. This has your cards,
 and there is a cheque book as well.
[1742.16] You don’t have to be dependent on anyone.
[1745.56] You can do what you want, independently.
[1747.72] I made the smartest decision of 
my life trusting you.
[1754.96] I will leave now,
[1756.36] I have to take Fatima to the doctor. Thank you.
[1758.56] Hey, listen, wait. Where are you going?
[1760.16] Wait. We just started talking. Please.
[1763.44] Shaheer will get really upset
 if I don’t take his daughter to the hospital…
[1766.12] He has you and his daughter 
caged in the four walls of that home.
[1771.04] Is that what you left everything for?
[1775.96] I am tired of all these things myself.
[1779.92] If you are tired, then leave him.
[1783.28] when you step out, 
a clear sky would be waiting for you to fly.
[1788.12] You will never turn back and look.
[1790.36] It is not that easy.
[1792.68] Only one thing makes it difficult
[1797.44] and that is Shaheer’s mad love for you.
[1802.08] The love is lost somewhere.
[1804.84] He doesn’t see anything else apart from his daughter.
[1808.64] Then think yourself what 
is important for Shaheer.
[1814.92] Sometime will pass and 
he will lose his heart to another girl.
[1820.28] Where will you exist then, Sajjal?
[1823.52] Today, the time is in your hands.
[1825.84] Tomorrow you will only have regret.
[1828.72] That is why you think hard once,
[1832.60] that how long will you compromise 
with Shaheer’s mood swings?
[1837.48] Think about it.
[1854.52] Hey madam Irha, you?
[1856.24] My heart is really worried brother Karamdad.
[1858.32] My daughter is not well, I have to meet her.
[1860.60] Go ahead.
[1868.36] Fatima.
[1870.00] Madam Irha.
[1874.08] It is good that you came.
[1875.88] Madam Fatima is really unwell.
[1878.32] Take her to the hospital.
[1884.36] She really has high fever.
[1886.88] Do you people not take care of her?
[1890.32] Come on, let’s take her to the hospital. Sure.
[1893.64] Fatima.
[1897.16] That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.
[1934.92] Thank God madam Irha that
[1936.24] you came at the right time and
 took madam Fatima to the hospital.
[1939.88] Seeing her condition, I got really worried.
[1943.20] How could I find peace when 
my daughter is suffering?
[1946.36] How could I not come?
[1952.32] How can Sajjal and
 Shaheer leave her alone and go?
[1957.64] Madam Sajjal had said that 
she would come back soon.
[1960.84] But it is evening, she has not come till now.
[1963.52] She is really careless towards the child,
[1966.76] and sir doesn’t understand it.
[1969.16] Hah,
[1970.96] Sajjal is not a mother that
[1972.84] she can understand such delicacies.
[1976.36] Shaheer should take care of these things.
[1979.92] Look. You please take care of Fatima’s diet.
[1988.20] I got really worried.
[1990.64] Madam Fatima got really unwell.
[1995.96] If you cannot take care of your daughter, 
then give me her responsibility.
[2001.00] Fatima will live with me.
[2005.32] You have left this home and gone.
[2007.20] Then fulfil the responsibilities 
of being a father with honesty.
[2020.04] How is she now?
[2022.08] Had madam Irha not come on time,
[2024.48] then God knows what would have happened today.
[2029.28] Madam Irha came as an angel today.
[2034.88] Did you call her and ask her to come?
[2036.72] No. No, sir. She is a mother.
[2039.96] Even when she was away, her motherhood longed,
[2043.28] and it made her stand in front of the child.
[2047.40] So where was Sajjal?
[2050.20] Sir, she got ready after you left and went.
[2053.56] I tried a lot to stop her,
[2055.40] but she didn’t listen to me
[2057.04] and she told me not to tell you either.
[2060.52] Sir, that…that…
[2064.12] What? Go ahead?
[2065.92] She will fire me from the job. 
Don’t worry about that.
[2069.56] Tell me, what is the matter?
[2071.04] She gets ready and 
goes away after you leave,
[2074.28] and she has no set time to come back.
[2076.80] I take care of madam Fatima, 
she is here with me.
[2080.60] Because of her madam Fatima got so unwell.
[2103.48] I was just leaving.
[2105.24] Whatever you did for Fatima,
[2108.32] I am indebted to you for that.
[2110.40] I didn’t do anyone a favour taking care of 
my daughter.
[2114.96] Irha,
[2117.84] I asked you to leave in my anger,
[2120.24] I did really wrong.
[2122.56] You are a really good and responsible mother, 
who even when she is far cares for her daughter.
[2128.40] If you want, you can come to meet Fatima,
[2131.44] at any time.
[2133.12] I have full hope that 
my daughter will not be left alone now.
[2137.08] Someone will be with her.
[2140.04] As far as taking care of her is concerned, 
then I have told Nafeesa.
[2143.72] We have to give her 
milk before giving her the medication,
[2146.12] or else the medicine will react.
[2149.60] Just take care of all these things.
[2152.32] Wont you stay for some time?
[2161.16] I have full hopes that 
Fatima’s father is with her,
[2165.04] and he will take care of her than me.
[2170.08] I will ask the driver… I have both a driver and a car. 
Thank you very much.
[2190.44] Everyone makes relations,
[2193.64] but only a few know how to live with them.
[2200.60] I wish you were faithful, Shaheer Ahmad,
[2204.16] then today both of us would have 
been with our daughter.
[2209.52] Your unfaithfulness ruined two relations.
[2214.44] You will not be able to understand
 the relationship between a mother and daughter,
[2220.56] because you live in relations out of need 
and not your heart.
