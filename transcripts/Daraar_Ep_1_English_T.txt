[106.36] Where are you coming from this hour?
[109.52] I went out with friends, I had a lot of fun.
[111.72] So was it so necessary for you to go that 
you left Faitma unwell and left.
[114.84] Hey, what is wrong? It was just a little fever.
[118.84] What is wrong? There is no big deal in it.
[121.08] And after all, children get fever.
[124.00] Nowadays the weather is such that 
every child catches fever.
[126.84] This was no ordinary fever. 
Had she not reached on time, then she could have lost her life.
[130.96] But why would a woman like you care, 
who sees no one other than herself.
[134.56] Excuse me, you are saying this to me.
[136.60] If Fatima is not my daughter, 
then she is your real daughter.
[139.16] If you were so worried,
 you should have stayed back and taken care of her.
[141.84] If I didn’t have an important meeting,
 then I would never have gone.
[144.52] If you were helpless, then I too was helpless. 
I couldn’t cancel my plans either.
[148.52] I have not given you freedom that 
you ignore the home and child all day long.
[152.04] I am not your slave that I obey your restrictions.
[154.52] This is my life and it is up to me how I live it.
[158.52] If you really liked restrictions so much, 
then why did you let her go?
[161.88] She enjoyed all these restrictions.
[164.20] At least she cared about her home and child.
[167.48] If she was not here today, 
then something bad would have happened.
[169.76] Oh,
[171.28] so this is the effect of her meeting that
 you are taking out all the faults in me.
[176.60] Does she want to come back to this home 
because of her daughter?
[180.84] Stop your nonsense.
[182.56] I have divorced her, okay? 
I will not hear any nonsense about her.
[185.56] Then why do you feel so much pain for her?
[188.12] I am not a child, 
that I don’t understand anything.
[190.48] You are regretting leaving her.
[192.76] actually, you deserve her.
[194.76] You are crossing your limits. 
You are crossing your limits.
[197.56] What do you want to say? 
She is a good girl, and I am a bad girl.
[201.32] How did you give her permission 
to come to this home?
[204.36] She is her mother,
[205.92] she can meet her when she wants.
 This is her right, no one can take it from her,
[209.08] and if you don’t like it so much,
then learn to stay at home.
[211.96] You are out all day long, 
you go to parties, I don’t like it at all.
[215.12] I shouldn’t hear after today that 
you went out anywhere.
[216.84] and what if I don’t listen to you, then?
[218.36] You will have to listen to me,
 because this is my home,
[220.48] and what I want will happen here.
[221.96] Then you too hear me out clearly,
[223.68] I cannot live in this prison.
[225.40] What did you say?
[226.64] Exactly what you heard.
[236.00] Look, is she fine now?
[238.00] Did she sleep well at night? 
Did she cry a lot?
[241.48] and you feed her something after every three hours,
[245.84] if she has weakness, she will fall ill further.
[248.52] And if there is any issue,
[250.52] call me and ask without hesitating.
[254.16] Where is Mr. Shaheer?
[262.56] Okay, fine.
[265.68] Yes, so what is the problem?
[267.68] Buy the shares from the loan we got from the bank.
[270.40] As soon as we get profit, we will return it.
[272.48] Sir, we have already purchased a lot shares
 for Sultan Group of Industries from the loan.
[277.92] Now we don’t have any more money to buy more shares.
[282.60] We will have to think of something else.
[285.00] Sir, did you talk to miss Irha 
in regards to the property?
[289.96] Yes, but I am not taking that property from her.
[292.24] We will have to make other arrangements.
[294.92] What is the minimum amount we need?
[298.00] I think two to two fifty million would be fine.
[301.20] What this will be is we will be able to survive
[303.84] and we will be able to pay off the bank loan 
with the money received from the profit.
[309.00] I will arrange this much.
[310.84] I have some more property,
[312.52] I will sell it. Give me some time,
[315.60] I will send you the documents.
[317.48] If this can be done soon,
[319.00] then I will talk to the dealer and 
make arrangements for the money.
[322.08] We have already made a big move already.
[325.36] The one who wins the move is considered the winner.
[328.36] I will send the documents till evening.
[330.96] Okay sir, thank you.
[332.76] Bye.
[335.44] Sajjal.
[337.68] I am here.
[342.16] You didn’t go to the office?
[344.16] No,
[345.32] I thought I would work from home today.
[347.52] After all, you complain that
[349.72] I don’t spend time with you. So here I am.
[353.80] I have to go to a committee party,
[358.40] my friends must be waiting for me.
[362.24] You won’t go anywhere, please.
[365.80] It is necessary for me to go,
[367.92] I will come back soon.
[369.56] Mrs. Zubair asked me with so much love,
 so I couldn’t say no to her.
[373.68] There is no need to go.
[375.48] I am at home, so you should be at home too.
[377.60] And then Fatima is not well either.
[379.84] You know if I don’t go, 
then people in the circle will talk.
[383.00] What the world talks about,
 I don’t care about it,
[385.72] and neither should you.
[387.52] It should be important for you what I think.
[399.92] What is this doing here?
[403.64] Why is it not in the locker?
[407.40] I got this.
[409.60] Maybe I forgot to tell you. It is ordinary.
[413.28] Looks quite costly.
[416.84] What is going on, Sajjal?
[421.52] What? Are you doubting me?
[425.56] I am scared seeing your changed behaviour.
[431.00] What is this love that wants to keep me chained,
[434.00] it makes you doubt me,
 it makes you get upset with me.
[438.16] I get helpless in your matter.
[441.40] I don’t know what I say. I am sorry.
[444.00] Please don’t mind.
[445.72] Okay listen,
[447.40] let’s have lunch together.
[448.84] It has been so many days that 
we have not eaten together even.
[450.84] Please.
[452.16] I am not hungry.
[453.40] If you are hungry, then ask Bilquis, 
she will make food for you.
[457.48] I am getting late.
[470.44] I have told you, you will get your order.
[473.00] There are delays in work.
[475.56] God damn it.
[487.40] I got this.
[489.64] Maybe I forgot to tell you. It is ordinary.
[502.36] Hello.
[503.36] It has been long that we met.
[506.28] Yes,
[507.56] I am a little disturbed for the past few days.
[510.00] Why? What happened?
[511.76] You know the situation is not good.
[517.16] The business is a little down.
[518.92] Yes, I found out a little.
[522.64] Not from you, I found out from others.
[525.80] It is not reasonable to talk about these things on the phone.
[529.48] Can you meet me?
[531.40] But where will we meet?
[533.48] I have a meeting in a hotel, 
I will send you the pin.
[536.80] I will also send you the room number.
[539.68] Okay.
[540.80] Okay, bye.
[542.32] Bye.
[547.84] What is happening with me?
[550.96] Along with the business, 
even Sajjal is looking away.
[554.40] There is something that 
Sajjal is changing so much.
[563.44] I too got impressed by your personality and money.
[569.08] But this too is a bitter truth that
[571.72] men like us forget truth and 
honesty in our pride and ego.
[580.80] We are unable to see the cunningness and
 opportunity seekers hidden behind make up on faces.
[587.44] A man recognizes a woman well.
[590.88] His eyes even see what the woman cannot see.
[598.24] The goodness and 
truth of a woman is written on her forehead.
[607.84] Every experiment taught me a new lesson.
[612.44] The situation got bad, even Sajjal looked away.
[621.44] To hell with such wealth that blinds us.
[624.84] We are unable to recognize the faithful relations 
and people in front of us.
[630.88] We are unable to take care of them.
[639.84] What is your real sorrow for?
[642.40] For Sajjal?
[643.68] Or Irha? Or the loss in the factory?
[646.72] Till yesterday, I had everything,
[650.20] wealth, love,
[654.00] a faithful wife in the form of Irha.
[657.24] God even blessed me with a daughter.
[660.72] But I was blindly running after a destination that
 I would never be able to get.
[666.20] I left every relation one by one.
[672.96] I am tired of running in this race.
[677.12] No one is there to lift me up.
[682.56] Your daughter is still there in your life.
[686.60] If you look at the eyes of reality,
[689.32] you will see several ways to live a right life.
[693.84] Apologies to the people you hurt.
[698.56] How do I apologies to them?
[701.36] No one will forgive me.
[703.56] How do I find mercy in their heart?
[706.40] You even find God if you search.
[709.48] Look in your heart.
[711.48] Wake up your conscience.
[714.16] Seek forgiveness from God and everyone else.
[718.56] I will also go now.
[720.64] Maybe I too am looking for a right path.
[728.60] Bye.
[768.28] You, here?
[770.80] Shaheer called me to meet.
[773.60] Oh, liar, cheat, is cheating me.
[778.60] We have an old relation.
[781.32] I was helpless at the hands of my heart, 
so I came to meet him.
[785.72] Hah,
[787.60] how was the meeting?
[791.00] When two old friends meet,
[793.00] a lot is discussed,
[795.16] situation and condition too.
[797.76] Oh, discussion?
[800.36] So he called you for a discussion.
[801.88] Yes,
[803.32] we talked about happiness and sorrow.
[806.24] You talked?
[808.56] You can think what you want.
[811.28] Me and Shaheer have had a long 
and deep relation.
[816.68] You have told me that.
[819.40] He is broken Sajjal.
[821.80] You came to piece him back together?
[824.36] You can think what you want.
[842.52] Thank you so much, you arranged a party for me.
[846.32] it was a lot of fun.
[849.12] This was really less for you, Sajjal.
[852.08] You deserve a lot more than this.
[855.44] Do I also deserve Shaheer Ahmad’s unfaithfulness?
[861.16] Why, what happened?
[863.56] Did something happen?
[867.00] I met Zoya.
[868.60] Zoya.
[871.08] Why are you getting angry and 
burning your blood?
[874.36] Shaheer has always been after women,
 maybe you just found out.
[878.12] Thank God his real face came in front of me.
[881.00] He made a lot of promises,
[883.88] and claimed his love for me.
[887.16] Shaheer Ahmad cannot belong to one person.
[890.20] I know,
[892.72] but he was doing dramas of love with me.
[896.04] How was I to know he was so bad in intentions?
[898.96] He is a cheap, cheat, and liar.
[902.56] I had told you earlier, 
you are wasting your time after him.
[907.32] I won’t do it now.
[910.56] Hi.
[927.36] I want to spend time with you, 
and you are running away from me.
[931.92] Why are you doing this?
[933.12] You want to spend time with me?
[934.80] Yes.
[935.84] Then what were you doing with Zoya?
[939.80] Zoya?
[941.68] You have a misunderstanding…
Don’t talk nonsense, I know it all.
[945.96] What were you doing?
[948.12] Why?
[949.92] You can go, but I can’t?
[954.28] You are competing with me?
[956.24] Yes, I am competing
[959.96] because in your defeat is my win.
[963.00] Sajjal.
[964.04] Sajjal, please.
[965.60] I am already really worried, don’t bother me more. 
I need your help.
[970.40] Look, you always had this complain from me,
 that I don’t share my things with you.
[974.88] The property I gave to you,
[977.04] I need its documents. I have to sell it.
[979.92] What?
[981.40] You had gifted it to me, why should I return it?
[984.24] I know. I know.
[985.80] look, as soon as the company’s condition will improve, 
I will get you a better home than that,
[989.64] but right now, I need those documents.
[992.56] I will not let you get mistreated Sajjal
[995.32] and I find it really bad saying this to you,
[998.28] because it is not my nature 
to take back something I gave, but please.
[1002.88] Sajjal, please, I need your help.
[1006.72] I have invested that.
[1009.76] Where did you invest it?
[1017.36] I am asking you something.
[1023.60] I invested it with Sultan Khan.
[1027.08] What?
[1028.40] You got into a partnership with 
my business partner without informing me?
[1031.72] Have you gone mad?
[1032.92] Yes, I have gone mad.
[1034.52] What else could I do?
[1036.00] I asked you so many times to get married. 
Stop putting allegations.
[1039.08] This is not an allegation, it is the truth.
[1041.24] You don’t give women more importance than a shirt.
[1044.04] Stay in your limit, Sajjal.
[1045.60] I stay in my limit and you cross all your limits? 
Be quiet.
[1049.72] I won’t stay quiet.
[1051.76] You cannot be trusted,
[1053.20] you will bring another woman and 
stand up in front of me.
[1055.68] So what would happen to me?
[1057.20] I had to think of a backup for me,
[1059.00] so I accepted his offer. And you know what?
[1062.92] He is much better than you.
[1065.36] in every way.
[1074.32] I put everything I had on the line for you.
[1078.60] I wasted my money,
[1079.92] I wasted myself, for a cheap girl like you.
[1082.32] and you got done with me, 
and you went to him.
[1091.36] He is much better than you. 
A successful businessman
[1096.40] and he takes care of me more than you.
[1099.60] Like I don’t know this investment is just an excuse.
[1102.76] The reality is that a loose character girl like you 
is impressed with his wealth,
[1106.72] like you were impressed by my wealth.
[1108.48] Am I lose character? Me or you?
[1111.40] Don’t forget, 
you had a relation with other boys before you.
[1115.16] Taking money from them was your habit.
[1117.24] That Shahrukh.
[1118.60] If I was not there, 
then you wouldn’t have been able to face anyone.
[1121.84] And the other boy,
 who left the neighbourhood overnight and went.
[1124.88] So don’t act so pure.
[1127.72] If I was attracted towards you,
[1129.56] then you shouldn’t have lost your way.
[1130.88] But you, yourself wanted this.
[1133.56] Okay.
[1135.20] Now I understand why you didn’t marry me.
[1139.28] You have so much hatred for me in your heart.
[1142.88] Yes, you cannot be trusted.
[1144.68] God knows what you will do after marriage.
[1146.60] The world will spit in my face.
[1149.40] You know what? It is done.
[1155.28] I don’t want to live with you now.
[1159.00] You deserve a girl like Irha,
[1162.76] that’s it.
[1164.92] Irha was a thousand times better than you.
[1168.04] She was faithful.
[1169.36] She considered the home a home.
[1172.12] I left her for your sake, 
and this is what I got in return.
[1175.92] And don’t forget that 
the way you are going around Sultan,
[1178.64] all that too is because of me or else you were, 
zero.
[1181.56] Zero!
[1187.28] There is a big difference in fulfilling your wishes 
and making a home, Sajjal.
[1191.48] But, a girl like you cannot understand this.
[1194.72] Because you are only a beautiful deceit,
[1196.96] nothing else.
[1199.28] No matter what,
[1202.24] I will not live with you. I am leaving.
[1206.84] Yes, go,
[1208.28] I will see how many days you survive without me.
[1210.88] Leave.
[1243.84] I have to meet you immediately.
[1246.28] I have left Shaheer Ahmad.
[1248.88] I want to shift to the new home immediately.
[1255.32] If you step foot out of this home, then remember, 
you will never find these doors open.
[1259.52] So take your step after thinking.
[1267.68] Did you hear what I said?
[1356.44] There is a crack in relations.
[1361.08] This had to happen one day.
[1367.68] You didn’t care about a faithful girl like Irha,
[1372.00] then why do you have hopes tied 
to an opportunist like Sajjal.
[1379.12] I had loved her with a true heart.
[1382.36] Sajjal.
[1385.24] I left my wife for her sake.
[1388.36] I ruined my well-set home.
[1391.76] How can she do this with me?
[1395.92] She cannot cheat me, she had promised me.
[1401.40] We had dreamed of living our lives together.
[1406.48] You cannot make a castle of your dreams 
by bringing tears in someone’s eyes, Shaheer Ahmed.
[1413.44] To make a home, 
it is necessary for two people to be faithful and honest.
[1418.68] Even one person’s weak attachment,
[1421.52] can become the reason for cracks in the hearts
 and relations.
[1428.64] The crack not only ruins those two people,
[1430.96] but even every relation attached to them.
[1436.68] Then try to mend 
this crack in fate as much as you can,
[1440.96] but whoever falls in this hole,
[1443.68] they never come back.
[1447.12] Neither Irha can come back,
[1449.72] nor Sajjal.
[1453.96] The crack you have formed,
[1456.00] you have fallen in its pit yourself, Shaheer.
[1462.12] There is a painful punishment for hurting heart.
[1465.76] You have to pay a heavy price.
[1469.68] This is the punishment you got for hurting Irha’s heart.
[1474.32] Your destruction has been written,
[1478.20] nothing can happen now.
[1480.80] Because you have lost the time.
[1520.76] Yes, Noman. What is the matter?
[1526.20] What?
[1527.80] How did the fire start?
[1530.28] Is anything left, or did everything get burned?
[1532.88] Okay, I am coming.
[1536.52] Oh, how much is the loss?
[1539.12] Nothing is left?
[1541.20] Very sad.
[1543.20] You people do one thing, 
cancel all shares of Shaheer group of industries.
[1548.32] We don’t want to do any contracts with them.
[1553.44] What happened with Shaheer Ahmed?
[1558.56] He got the result of cheating a girl like you.
[1562.88] A fire started in the factory, nothing is left.
[1564.88] Everything went up in flames.
[1567.00] What?
[1569.84] I know he has really hurt you,
[1572.60] but today, make me a promise.
[1575.12] I shouldn’t see tears in these eyes after today.
[1582.12] I was in love with him,
[1585.24] but he wanted to chain me and control him.
[1588.72] Then that life imprisonment is over.
[1591.40] You are out of his control.
[1595.44] He repaid me well for my love.
[1599.72] It was all the intoxication of wealth.
[1601.80] Now he will come to his senses.
[1603.92] He is out of money.
[1606.40] Think if the business is over, 
the person is over.
[1609.32] I want to become a successful business woman.
[1611.88] Absolutely, 
you should take your business forward.
[1615.40] Shaheer’s love is left behind,
[1617.96] never turn back and look at it.
[1620.44] And don’t keep his hatred with you either,
[1623.44] it will not let you progress.
[1631.36] Go ahead, Noman.
[1634.72] All the material for production got burned, sir,
[1637.96] nothing is left.
[1641.08] Everything burned down to ashes.
[1644.56] We had got a loan on the same factory from the bank.
[1647.92] And the contracts we had done,
[1651.56] the deadline for delivery is near.
[1654.48] All the material got burned,
[1656.48] but we don’t even have money that 
we can make a promise.
[1661.48] I don’t understand what will happen now.
[1668.08] But how did this fire start?
[1670.76] There was a short circuit.
[1673.56] Some workers 
were also there in the factory at that time,
[1677.12] those people also got burned and died.
[1680.36] Their families will create a separate scene now, 
sir.
[1689.76] You go, Noman.
[1709.20] Famous businessman 
Shaheer Ahmad’s factory caught fire,
[1712.00] because of which the company 
has faced a loss in billions.
[1714.96] Because of this the company’s share 
value has gone down.
[1717.96] All the companies that were shareholders with him,
[1720.28] have announced to cancel all their shares.
[1723.00] The business community has expressed 
their sorrow to the company owner, Irha,
[1725.60] Shaheer Ahmed.  what happened?
[1727.68] Shaheer’s factory caught fire.
[1730.28] Everything got burned to ashes.
[1734.28] All this had to happen.
[1737.04] He had a lot of pride on his wealth and money.
[1741.20] See.
[1742.28] See, how everything burned down to ashes.
[1746.16] Everything is ruined,
[1748.52] Hey, what do we have to do with this? 
Huh?
[1751.64] When he had made you cry 
and dragged you out,
[1754.52] then wouldn’t your sigh have reached the sky?
[1757.64] It surely must have.
[1759.84] Now you will see after Shaheer’s destruction,
[1762.72] how Sajjal will go around aimlessly.
[1766.76] How can you curse your own daughter?
[1769.68] The girl who has ruined 
the respect of relations after her desires,
[1775.28] I don’t even want to hear her mention.
[1777.20] And neither is there any room 
for her to seek forgiveness.
[1782.48] And after today, you too hear it,
[1784.84] I don’t want to hear her name from you at all.
[1789.76] Now you pack the things, get ready.
[1792.36] We will shift in our new home.
[1794.84] Because I don’t want that 
I have to face Sajjal after Shaheer’s destruction.
[1800.60] I don’t even want to see her.
[1848.40] Sir, should I serve food?
[1850.68] No.
[1886.16] I took her out of my life,
[1889.68] everything I had has been put on the line.
[1893.44] I wish, unlucky me, was able to know her worth.
[1930.96] This is how the emotions of love and hate are like.
[1935.04] They chain your feet.
[1941.16] I am not dependent on anyone now.
[1945.56] I want to keep myself free.
[1949.20] It is good.
[1953.64] From today, start your new life.
[1959.44] Yes, but not here.
[1963.08] Neither with you, nor with anyone else.
[1969.28] I have booked my tickets,
[1972.08] I am leaving tonight.
[1975.36] Thank you so much, you have really helped me,
[1979.00] but now I want to be free from all this.
[1998.20] Aunt, I will give the keys to the neighbours.
[2001.80] They will open the door and 
get the home cleaned once in a while.
[2006.00] When we don’t have to come back here,
[2008.28] then what is the point of giving the keys?
[2010.52] There is no need. Come.
[2013.48] As you wish.
[2025.48] Come on, child.
[2036.00] Yes, Noman, is everything okay?
[2038.56] I am coming to the office.
[2041.76] Sir, there is a bad news.
[2043.64] What?
[2045.72] Sultan group of companies has cancelled all our shares.
[2051.60] This had to happen.
[2053.56] Sir, you already knew?
[2055.76] Every person has such a time in his life
[2059.12] when he witnesses the show 
of his destruction with his own eyes.
[2063.40] But he is so helpless, he can do nothing.
[2068.04] Think I am going through the same.
[2070.52] What will we do sir?
[2072.04] The bank loan is really high
[2073.80] and even the factory has burden down.
[2078.72] Try to buy shares of a small company that
[2081.36] we get from the contract cancelation.
[2085.12] But sir, what will that do?
[2087.28] To start fresh,
[2089.52] it is not important if the step is big or small,
 the step is important.
[2093.40] We don’t have to give up right now.
[2100.88] And I need you at this time.
[2102.84] Sure, sir.
[2104.08] Yeah.
[2126.60] You?
[2128.84] Fatima. Mama.
[2130.64] Fatima.
[2132.60] Mama. Go.
[2173.60] You have set the home well.
[2177.84] I didn’t do anything great in this.
[2181.20] The company did all this.
[2187.32] I had thought that you would not meet me.
[2202.16] Irha, I had turned really evil.
[2208.68] I had felt that no one can defeat me.
[2216.84] Then time changed in such a way,
[2221.72] that it threw me on the ground from the skies.
[2225.84] In a few days, everything ended.
[2232.00] I got insulted and 
defamed in front of the whole city.
[2244.40] Yes, but I understood one thing.
[2249.80] God lives in the hearts 
if you break a person’s heart,
[2253.56] then God will get upset with you.
[2269.32] I had thought that I am someone,
[2271.96] who would touch anything and it will turn to gold.
[2277.36] But I was wrong.
[2282.88] Grandma was right,
[2286.36] you are my lucky charm.
[2289.84] When you came in my life,
[2293.32] I forgot to lose.
[2299.40] I didn’t know your worth,
[2302.52] so I turned into dust.
[2307.88] Even Sajjal didn’t leave me
 capable to face anyone.
[2313.32] She said that
[2314.96] I didn’t know your worth, 
so how would I know your worth.
[2321.00] She was right.
[2325.00] I couldn’t love anyone apart from myself.
[2333.72] Irha, I didn’t come here to apologize and 
become good in your eyes.
[2339.16] My sin is really big.
[2342.88] I came here to hand over my daughter to you.
[2347.12] I cannot trust anyone apart from you in the world.
[2352.16] You will bring her up better than me.
[2355.96] Are you going somewhere, Shaheer?
[2363.24] I don’t know,
[2365.84] what will I do, where will I go?
[2368.88] I have darkness in front of me. 
I don’t understand anything.
[2375.44] I just have one request from you.
[2383.08] Make sure my daughter doesn’t hate me.
[2387.16] Please.
[2390.44] I have already fallen in my own eyes
 and the world’s eyes.
[2396.56] I will not be able to tolerate my daughter’s hatred.
[2404.24] No matter how bad character a man is,
[2408.28] he truly loves his children.
[2412.08] My daughter shouldn’t get punished for my sins.
[2416.52] Make her like you.
[2426.40] I knew your worth really late, Irha,
[2429.48] but now I know it.
[2432.68] I am really, really, sorry for everything.
[2440.84] Even I don’t know
 if I will ever be able to forgive you or not.
[2450.12] But just like I am Fatima’s mother, 
you are her father
[2456.20] and Fatima is both our responsibility, 
not just one of us.
[2469.96] Shaheer, I have decided,
 the two of us will bring up Fatima together.
[2478.28] She will stay with you for a week and
 one week with me,
[2483.04] and the two of us will have to live up 
to this responsibility well.
[2490.96] We will have to do this for Fatima.
[2498.24] This is a big favour you are doing on me.
[2503.24] I am not doing anyone a favour.
[2508.72] A child is the result of the love of two people.
[2514.28] And if those two have a crack,
[2517.76] then it shouldn’t impact the children.
[2527.68] The mistakes of the parents 
shouldn’t come on the parents,
[2531.72] or they become affected by inferiority complex even
 if you don’t want to.
[2536.16] And I don’t want to bring up 
my daughter like this.
[2542.60] If I keep her with me, 
then she will miss her father,
[2546.20] if she stays with you, she will miss me.
[2551.80] we cannot put our child in torment because of us.
[2557.68] That is why, 
Fatima is the responsibility of both of us
[2562.44] and we will have to live up to it with honesty.
[2567.24] Thank you, Irha.
[2569.40] Thank you so much.
[2574.88] Believe me, I didn’t have a reason to live on,
[2581.72] but your behaviour and 
goodness has given me new courage.
[2591.08] I know, I couldn’t be a good husband,
[2594.68] but I promise, I will be a good father.
[2602.36] Thank you for supporting me at a time in 
my life when I was completely hopeless.
[2611.60] Thank you.
[2614.64] You don’t need to thank me.
[2617.80] This is my responsibility
[2620.44] and I will live up to it well becoming a mother.
[2714.12] Hi. Having a good time.
[2716.28] Shaheer, shall we cut the cake?
[2718.64] Once Irha comes, we will cut it.
[2720.36] Okay, so you have called Irha too?
[2722.40] Of course, sister in law, she is both our daughter.
[2724.36] It is necessary for both of us to be in her happiness.
[2727.08] Excuse me.
[2728.96] See,
[2730.48] even though they got separated but together
 they are taking up the responsibility of the child completely.
[2736.04] You are right.
[2737.40] if not good life partners,
[2739.52] but both of them are good parents.
[2746.48] Oh, there’s my princess.
[2748.92] Once mama comes, we will cut your cake. 
Mama is here.
[2752.52] Oh.
