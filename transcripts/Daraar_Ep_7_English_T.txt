[61.80] What will happen with me, will happen.
[64.60] I too will see what can you achieve after the label of
 Shaheer Ahmed is removed from you.
[67.96] Shaheer, please…
[69.08] You still have time.
[70.72] If you love your child so much, 
then live in this home quietly, respectfully.
[75.08] This cannot happen.
[77.52] Then Fatima too wont go anywhere.
[206.96] Stop.
[208.36] Why are you creating a scene?
[212.20] In the eyes of the world you are still my wife.
[218.36] If you want, you can stay.
[300.04] Come in.
[312.76] What is the matter?
[318.72] Sir,
[321.52] settle my account.
[328.32] Now I don’t want to live in this home.
[333.80] What happened to you?
[335.24] Where are you going?
[342.52] This home is not worth living in now, sir.
[348.72] I feel suffocation in the air of this home.
[359.64] Forgive me, sir.
[363.40] But I was living here for madam Irha.
[367.16] When madam Irha is not here,
[369.48] then I don’t deserve to stay here.
[374.20] I didn’t pay you a good salary for Irha.
[377.68] Maybe, you are forgetting it.
[379.40] Along with the money, the respect I got from her,
[383.80] no other woman can give it.
[392.80] And I cannot even think about it for madam Sajjal.
[400.20] Shut up.
[406.84] What nonsense is this?
[409.08] Do you have no manners to talk?
[413.48] I would say, 
settle his account and send him away.
[422.40] If you are mistaken that
[425.04] you too will leave from here, and I will stop you,
 then nothing like that will happen.
[429.32] I don’t make anyone my helplessness.
[435.52] Sajjal, settle his account,
[437.36] and give him more than what he deserves.
[439.36] Giving less is against my respect.
[476.96] Here you go and get out of here.
[516.28] And I too pray that
[519.52] I never come face to face with me in my life,
[523.08] because the woman who breaks the heart and 
home of her sister,
[534.80] neither the world forgives her,
[538.24] and nor does God. I told you to get lost.
[540.76] Get out of here.
[574.28] What did you see in her?
[580.48] Peace.
[585.04] Happiness.
[586.88] Feelings.
[588.40] Something that I don’t get from you, now.
[591.40] Oh,
[595.00] I will be disappointed that 
I kept you tortured for so long.
[602.60] But now you two choose each other,
[608.76] because by nature such girls don’t settle for one man.
[631.52] And such men don’t stay with one woman either.
[697.92] Uncle.
[699.88] Irha, child,
[700.92] you are here at this hour?
[703.20] Please. What happened? Irha.
[704.88] Oh God,
[705.84] what happened to her?
[707.16] she seems to be in a really bad condition.
[708.72] Irha, be strong. Listen, take her inside, 
I will go call the doctor.
[714.72] Okay. Okay. Careful. Careful.
[716.88] Careful. Hey child, what happened?
[743.48] Oh God, Nafeesa, make her get quiet. 
Why is she not getting quiet?
[747.24] Sister, I am trying in front of you.
[749.16] I even gave her milk, but she is not getting quiet.
[752.08] What happened?
[758.28] Give her to me, I will make her get quiet.
[760.04] My child. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.
[763.96] Why is she crying so much?
[766.00] Obviously, her mother is not there, 
so she will cry.
[769.12] That’s it. Be quiet. That’s it.
[770.88] You got tired of her so quickly.
[773.48] Give her to me.
[774.48] Hey, I am not tired, I am just saying that 
the child will cry without her mother.
[779.60] Why don’t you return her?
[799.24] Okay, sister Noshaba, I will leave.
[803.08] Doctor, is there something to worry about?
[806.92] No, nothing to worry about.
[809.20] I have given her a sedative, 
she will wake up in the morning.
[813.40] Doctor, what happened to her?
[817.12] She is going through a mental trauma,
[819.24] because of which her nervous system has been affected.
[821.68] If she rests, she will be fine. Don’t worry.
[823.92] Thank you very much. Come on.
[864.48] Papa’s princess doesn’t have to cry.
[866.40] Don’t cry at all.
[868.76] Good girl.
[871.16] I love you.
[897.92] I love you.
[900.00] You made her stop crying. How did you do it?
[903.36] I am her father,
[904.84] she was at peace when she came in my arms.
[908.60] Okay, give her to me.
[909.72] I will leave her in the room.
[911.52] She will disturb you at night. No. No.
[913.52] She is at peace right now.
[915.16] If you hold her, she will get disturbed. Leave it.
[919.16] But she will wake up at night,
[923.64] your sleep will get disturbed. I will drop her.
[926.36] I will manage.
[927.96] I can do this much for my daughter.
[930.04] No problem.
[960.60] Should we call Shaheer or not?
[965.72] I don’t know if Irha informed him
 or not before coming.
[971.32] Shaheer must be worried.
[975.36] If there was something like that,
[976.96] Shaheer would have called and
 found out till now.
[979.92] But I don’t know why, my sixth sense is telling me that
 these two surely had a fight.
[985.64] That is why she left the child there as well. Hey,
[989.44] I didn’t even think about the child.
[991.96] Hey, Sajjal is there, ask her what happened.
[994.76] Sajjal should have ideally come back with Irha.
[998.36] Hey,
[999.24] it is also possible that 
she stayed there because of the child.
[1003.28] But how is this possible? 
She could have called.
[1005.64] She could have informed us by calling.
[1007.96] I…I will call Sajjal.
[1028.24] I will call Shaheer, talk…
 No need to call Shaheer.
[1032.56] When he is not calling us himself,
[1034.12] then why should we call him?
[1035.84] Shaheer really loves Irha.
[1038.96] Then what happened, 
that she had to leave home.
[1042.60] Hey, right now we don’t know 
if they had a fight or something else happened that she came.
[1049.32] May God keep everything fine.
[1052.84] I pray to God that she regains consciousness, 
then only will we find out the real thing.
[1056.64] When Irha came home and fainted,
[1060.40] her condition was clearly saying that 
something undesirable has happened.
[1065.16] I pray to God something like that has happened.
[1119.96] Who is calling?
[1124.48] Why are you not answering it?
[1128.16] What do I say after answering it?
 Irha must have told them everything.
[1134.24] So?
[1135.84] All this had to happen one day,
[1138.52] you wanted it yourself.
[1140.28] What is the problem?
[1142.00] All that is fine, Shaheer,
[1144.32] but it will happen suddenly like this,
 I didn’t think of this.
[1147.64] and Irha’s reaction was so strict.
[1151.12] You know how beloved she is to papa. 
How much he loves him.
[1156.64] You are worried about your image?
[1159.60] Yes.
[1161.60] Wont I be worried?
[1166.28] On one hand you claim to have burned all boats in my love
[1170.28] and on the other hand you are worried about your family.
[1173.52] How will you face the world?
[1176.44] I am not stepping back from anything.
[1178.32] I am just saying that
[1180.04] if all this had happened in a reasonable manner, 
then it would have been better.
[1184.36] Homes don’t break in a reasonable manner.
[1189.28] Anyway,
[1191.04] I have removed the complaint you had from me.
[1194.60] Now it is your turn.
[1196.40] Switch off your mobile and forget your old life,
[1201.32] this is better for the both of us.
[1559.32] On one hand you claim to have burned all boats in my love
[1563.32] and on the other hand you are worried about your family.
[1566.32] How will you face the world?
[1569.36] I am not stepping back from anything.
[1571.28] I am just saying that
[1573.04] if all this had happened in a reasonable manner, 
then it would have been better.
[1579.00] Homes don’t break in a reasonable manner.
[1583.76] Anyway,
[1585.36] I have removed the complaint you had from me.
[1588.76] Now it is your turn.
[1597.04] Reaching so close to the destination and 
stepping back is nothing but stupidity.
[1607.44] No,
[1608.72] I cannot bargain on my dreams.
[1617.08] Mama and papa will get really upset right now,
[1620.48] but after some time they too will agree.
[1628.20] Life has blessed with a lot of difficulty,
[1632.44] and I cannot let go of this opportunity.
[1636.52] This home, wealth and Shaheer,
[1639.92] everything is only mine.
[1642.40] Only and only mine.
[1647.40] And I too pray that
[1650.52] I never come face to face with me in my life,
[1653.96] because the woman who breaks the heart 
and home of her sister,
[1663.20] neither the world forgives her,
[1666.68] and nor does God.
[1667.60] I told you to get lost from here.
[1669.12] Get lost.
[1674.32] She was in the habit
[1680.00] from the start to put her respect and 
name on the line.
[1696.92] But when did you fall so low?
[1699.12] If you step out of this home, then remember, 
coming back won’t be possible.
[1711.04] What sort of a mother are you, Irha?
[1713.12] How can you leave a few day old child, 
and go like this?
[1715.76] Are you not ashamed?
[1844.92] Are you awake, child?
[1851.28] Your Irha is ruined, uncle.
[1856.84] Don’t say that child,
[1859.68] have faith in God.
[1866.32] God will fix everything.
[1870.88] Nothing will get fixed.
[1874.28] Everything is over.
[1877.40] Irha, child,
[1879.08] what happened?
[1881.52] What did Shaheer say?
[1890.72] Shaheer has left me
[1896.84] and he even snatched my daughter from me.
[1903.16] Shaheer likes someone else, uncle.
[1911.48] He wants to marry her.
[1918.84] I have no problem.
[1923.28] He can marry who he wants, 
he should just give me my daughter.
[1929.04] I cannot live without Fatima, uncle.
[1933.36] Irha child,
[1935.16] you stop crying.
[1937.52] everything will be fine.
[1942.32] You used to say that
[1943.80] Shaheer can give his life for you,
[1945.96] then what is all this?
[1948.36] The one who could give his life, 
is adamant on taking my life.
[1957.12] Smart people have said correctly,
[1963.40] a man is a snake.
[1973.32] No one knows when he will bite.
[1987.44] What woman came in between you two
[1990.80] because of which he forgot about his wife 
and his daughter?
[1997.32] When the foundation of your own home is weak,
[2001.36] then how can someone complain to the 
person throwing stones?
[2013.88] I am not disappointed that 
someone else’s magic worked on Shaheer.
[2026.92] In fact, I am disappointed that 
he has forgotten my faithfulness.
[2039.32] Hamid Ali, why are you sitting quietly? 
Say something.
[2046.20] You will have to go talk to Shaheer.
[2048.20] There is no need to talk to anyone, aunt.
[2052.72] Just bring me my daughter back, 
I cannot live without her.
[2057.72] I cannot live without Fatima, aunt. Please.
[2061.88] Okay. Everything will be fine, child.
