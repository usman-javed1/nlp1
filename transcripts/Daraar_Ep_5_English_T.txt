[24.40] How are you?
[27.48] One meeting is necessary for me to live, love
[33.40] I will meet you my love,
[35.16] but right now there are some problems.
[37.08] Okay,
[38.36] I thought you have given your heart to someone else,
[40.76] that is why you don’t miss me.
[44.20] You know what I like that most about you?
[46.96] You don’t pretend.
[48.76] You accept whatever is there.
[51.12] Those who are afraid of the world pretend.
[55.08] I have no such helplessness.
[57.68] Did you not miss me,
[60.00] or is she more beautiful?
[63.76] Who, she?
[65.36] The same,
[66.60] for whom you have dragged your wife out of the home.
[72.92] Your wife’s cousin.
[77.12] How do you know?
[78.84] You live in my heart, Shaheer,
[81.04] it is impossible I don’t have news of you.
[85.00] For the first time I am jealous of someone, 
Shaheer.
[88.92] It has been six months,
[90.80] and you have not come to meet me.
[92.60] She is the reason for this.
[95.16] Where are you nowadays?
[96.72] I am around you.
[98.68] I will come across her one day,
[101.16] and when I meet her, I will take her life.
[106.64] I am unable to accept this unfaithfulness.
[124.16] Where is your conscience dead, 
Shaheer?
[128.04] Where did you put your conscience to sleep?
[132.48] Grandma got killed 
because of your shamelessness and cold bloodedness.
[139.64] That grandma who had faith in you,
[142.40] but you didn’t have shame.
[144.00] you are crossing your limits.
[145.60] You have crossed your limits.
[151.24] You don’t remember anything.
[156.00] Not the family name,
[160.88] not rules, neither respect for relations.
[164.08] Shut your nonsense, or else… 
Or else what?
[168.48] What will you do?
[173.32] Divorce me?
[178.28] Or leave me? Or drag me out of your home?
[185.76] There will be no need for that,
[191.60] because before that 
I am leaving you myself and going.
[269.84] Hello.
[272.56] Fine, make them sit in the drawing room,
 I am coming.
[281.24] Thank you, Shaheer.
[282.88] For what? For the new staff.
[284.56] Oh.
[286.36] You like it?
[287.32] Yes, everything is fine.
[289.20] But the cook is okay,
[292.60] I will try him for two three days, 
if I don’t like the taste, I will get him changed.
[296.04] The home is yours, so is the staff,
[297.72] change whoever you want.
[299.32] Hah.
[300.60] Today, I don’t hear Fatima cry. 
What is the deal?
[303.08] I think you have learned to take care of her.
[305.00] I gave her to the maid.
[306.44] She cries so much.
[308.24] When she starts crying, she doesn’t stop.
[310.52] I don’t know who she takes up after.
[313.52] Come with me, 
I have to talk to you about something important.
[316.68] What is it that you cannot talk about in the room?
[319.64] I will tell you. Come.
[335.32] Your parents are here.
[362.40] You can do it.
[367.28] They think I have kept you here forcefully.
[371.92] In fact, I have kept you hostage.
[376.60] Today, tell them what the truth is yourself.
[380.76] Shaheer Ahmed,
[389.08] we have come to take Sajjal.
[399.88] And we will not go without taking her.
[402.36] and if she doesn’t want to leave herself, then?
[419.48] Shaheer is right.
[424.04] I don’t want to leave him and go anywhere.
[447.72] But,
[450.48] with what relation will you live with him here?
[459.68] The two of us love each other,
[461.52] and we will get married really soon too.
[474.68] Did you not have shame?
[478.40] You are the daughter of a religious father.
[483.00] Hey, you should have had a little shame 
or had some respect.
[489.12] Don’t forget that
 you are standing in my home right now.
[493.40] What will you do?
[497.20] What can you do?
[498.72] She is our daughter.
[500.00] We will talk to her like we want,
[501.68] who are you to interfere? 
I am living here by my will.
[507.24] No one can force me to leave from here.
[510.40] Leave from here.
[515.56] You have forgotten the respect of relation,
[522.96] your shame, everything.
[525.48] No matter what you say, 
it won’t change my decision.
[528.56] And if you people don’t want 
to keep a relation with me,
[531.00] then don’t. Even I am not interested in keep 
any relation with you people.
[534.52] What tone are you talking to him with?
[536.64] Have you forgotten?
[537.92] He is your father.
[542.12] You will go around aimlessly.
[543.88] You will be insulted in front of the whole world.
[545.96] You will not be able to face anyone.
[548.52] And why are you on a mission to 
get us insulted in our old age.
[551.88] Noshaba, let her be.
[560.20] She has become ill-mannered and shameless.
 Her conscience is dead.
[571.88] Is this what I taught her?
[578.08] That she steals in her own home.
[582.08] You people have heard Sajjal’s decision.
[586.04] You people can leave.
[587.64] We too don’t want to keep a relation
[590.24] with this cheap and shameless child.
[597.60] She is dead for us.
[599.36] Then why are you people standing here?
[600.32] Go from here.
[608.56] Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali.
[611.08] Papa. Papa.
[719.48] Mama. Papa.
[721.60] Leave from here.
[723.08] Get lost from here.
[724.64] And don’t you dare go near my husband.
[727.48] Go from here. And you two leave from here, 
get lost from here.
[730.60] Mama… Your mother is dead.
[733.68] Go from here. Leave.
[737.88] I will go meet, papa…Go away from here.
[741.48] What are you doing?
[745.16] Sajjal, come. Come with me. 
Leave from here. Go.
[806.28] Uncle.
[886.68] Forgive…forgive…forgive…forgive me.
[893.40] What is your fault in this, uncle?
[896.28] This was my fate.
[899.72] Don’t blame yourself. 
Nothing will happen to you,
[903.24] you will be absolutely fine.
[909.84] Uncle?
[911.00] Aunt, why is uncle not saying anything?
[913.96] Hamid Ali.
[914.64] Uncle….Hamid Ali.
[916.20] Doctor. Look here. 
Talk to me Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali.
[920.84] Doctor, see what happened to my husband.
[923.40] Uncle is not saying anything. See,
[925.64] what happened to him. Hamid Ali.
[927.60] Uncle. Hamid Ali.
[929.36] Hamid Ali.
[931.00] Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali.
[934.08] What happened?
[936.88] I am sorry, he is no longer in this world.
[939.16] Uncle.
[994.76] You are the daughter of a religious father.
[998.08] Hey, you should have had a little shame
 or had some respect.
[1006.96] You will go around aimlessly.
[1008.68] You will be insulted in front of the whole world.
[1011.16] You will not be able to face anyone.
[1013.28] And why are you 
on a mission to get us insulted in our old age.
[1024.08] You people have heard Sajjal’s decision.
[1027.96] You people can leave.
[1029.56] We too don’t want to keep a relation 
with this cheap and shameless child.
[1039.68] She is dead for us.
[1041.40] Then why are you people standing here?
[1042.40] Go from here.
[1064.04] What are you doing?
[1066.12] I am serving you,
[1068.44] and serving you is my responsibility, 
don’t stop me from it. Get up.
[1074.00] Your place is in my heart, not in my feet.
[1076.88] Don’t do this again. Okay?
[1078.64] Irha also used to do it, 
you never stopped her.
[1082.12] She was my wife,
[1083.80] you are my lover.
[1085.64] A wife can sit in the feet, 
but not the lover.
[1096.40] I want your companionship,
[1113.00] You are sitting here.
[1114.88] I was waiting for you in the room.
[1125.68] Whatever happened today,
 it shouldn’t have happened.
[1131.08] You are regretting so soon.
[1135.20] I shouldn’t have left the hospital like this.
[1138.12] I don’t know what condition papa would be in.
[1141.20] Those people don’t want to see your face,
[1143.52] and you want to stay in the hospital.
[1147.28] They are my parents,
[1149.08] they have a right to be upset with me,
[1151.56] and it is my obligation to convince them.
[1154.28] I don’t want that 
our new life should start by upsetting them.
[1162.00] Okay,
[1163.36] then who has stopped you?
[1164.64] Go ahead.
[1168.00] Will you come along with me to convince them?
[1171.36] You go.
[1173.36] Shaheer, if the two of us go together 
it would be easy to convince papa.
[1180.16] Your mother really insulted me.
[1182.52] But Shaheer…No buts. 
If you want to go, then go.
[1187.36] I will not go there on any condition.
[1188.92] That’s it.
[1191.88] Please. For my sake.
[1195.80] I ruined my home for your sake,
[1198.64] you still doubt my love.
[1200.48] I wouldn’t even doubt you even if I was dead.
[1205.48] I was just saying it.
[1208.32] Don’t say anything.
[1211.56] I am going to sleep,
[1242.08] Your mother is dead.
[1244.36] You have killed my husband.
[1247.36] Go from here. Leave.
[1248.76] I will go meet, papa… Go away from here.
[1364.44] Yes, Shaheer, I just came home,
[1366.92] to meet papa. My heart was really worried.
[1369.92] Why do you worry?
[1371.60] You are his child,
[1373.56] and then you didn’t do anything wrong.
[1376.12] You also have a right to live your life by your liking.
[1379.92] Maybe you are forgetting that Irha takes papa’s side,
[1384.56] and you know, only God knows 
how much she would have instigated him by now.
[1389.72] Look, she will do anything in her jealousy,
[1392.52] because you are trying to take her place.
[1396.68] But you have to be strong,
[1400.00] for the sake of our love.
[1402.52] Okay?
[1404.48] Where is Fatima?
[1406.08] No, Fatima is with the maid.
[1408.92] She will take care of her.
[1411.68] You know she cannot stay with strangers.
[1414.84] You should have kept her with you.
[1417.68] Shaheer, she was sleeping.
[1419.64] After all, I have not come for long, 
I will come back home in a little while.
[1424.84] Okay. Anyway,
[1427.04] be brave.
[1428.52] Even if they don’t agree, 
still my love wont be any less for you.
[1433.24] You are my love.
[1434.76] The world should bend for you, not you.
[1440.52] I love you Shaheer.
[1441.76] I love you too. Bye.
[1466.36] Rayyan, is everything fine, son?
[1470.56] Sister Sajjal, don’t you know?
[1473.36] What don’t I know?
[1475.36] Your father passed away.
[1477.68] What?
[1551.12] Papa.
[1552.28] Papa.
[1553.96] Papa.
[1558.60] Papa.
[1559.56] Don’t touch him.
[1560.92] Get out of here.
[1562.20] You are the murderer of my Hamid Ali.
[1567.12] Leave from here. Get lost.
[1569.08] Mama, let me see papa’s face…
You are dead for us.
[1572.96] And you died 
the time when you stole your sister’s right.
[1577.96] But you,
[1579.60] your infelicity didn’t end.
[1581.40] You didn’t stop.
[1582.92] You took Hamid Ali’s life. 
I say leave from here.
[1586.28] Leave from here, or I will take your life.
[1588.52] Leave. Get of here. Leave. Mama,
[1590.96] Mama, I beg of you. Please
[1593.04] just once, let me see my father's face. 
then I'll leave from here
[1595.96] Before, I’ll kill you with my own hands,
 get out of here.
[1600.16] Aunt, this is not the time to do all this.
[1602.32] Leave her. Let her be. You leave.
[1605.04] What does she think?
[1606.52] She will do everything and 
no one will question her.
[1611.12] I said leave from here.
[1613.04] Why didn’t you die? Leave from here, 
leave. Get lost.
[1616.96] What are you doing? 
What are you saying?
[1619.76] You will regret it.
[1621.28] I am your own child, mama. 
And go where you had stained your face.
[1630.52] There is no place for you in this home, 
get lost from here.
[1633.32] Our relation has ended.
[1635.88] And if you step in this home,
[1638.76] you will see my dead face.
[1641.24] Leave from here. Get out of here.
[1643.56] Get lost.
[1645.04] Tell her to get lost from here.
[1665.96] Sit down.
[1668.80] Sit down.
[1674.52] Give me water.
[1677.28] Drink some water.
[1685.04] That’s it, aunt.
[1687.68] I am really worried for Irha.
[1689.96] Hey, as per religion and law, 
both of them can stay married.
[1695.72] With the condition that a woman tolerates it.
[1700.40] That too like her.
[1701.80] If Irha’s husband had to do this,
[1703.68] then he would have just married Sajjal.
[1705.92] What was the need to ruin Irha’s life?
[1708.44] I feel sorry for Irha.
[1712.28] Poor thing.
[1714.52] I think the husband snatched her daughter too,
[1717.80] I don’t see her anywhere.
[1719.68] Yes, I don’t see her anywhere.
[1722.32] You people saw how 
I dragged Sajjal out of this home.
[1727.80] Hey, she is dead for us, 
we have no relation with her.
[1731.40] I have just one daughter. 
Just one daughter, Irha.
[1740.96] I beg you people, for God’s sake,
[1743.48] if you want to be part of our sorrow,
 then for God’s sake,
[1747.36] let my Hamid Ali leave in peace.
[1752.08] That’s it, aunt.
[1763.64] There must be some room. 
Why did you not try to convince them?
[1768.12] I have tried my best sir,
[1770.16] but I am sorry to say that 
maybe this is not a good time for us.
[1775.08] That is why every deal 
we make is getting cancelled after being finalized.
[1778.80] And we have a loss of billions.
[1780.60] But how is it possible?
[1782.72] You know what 
they say about me in the business community?
[1785.52] I have got the Midas touch.
[1787.00] Whatever I touch turns to gold.
[1789.80] It used to turn to gold,
[1791.36] but now that same gold is turning to sand.
[1794.56] Sir, we had still not settled from the
 deal in Germany that we have faced another big loss.
[1799.32] If this continues to be the condition,
 then the company can go bankrupt soon.
[1804.20] Nothing like that will happen.
[1806.16] Ups and downs come in business.
[1809.24] You make a contract with Lashari industries,
[1811.56] I am sure 
we will be able to get our shares back within a month.
[1815.56] I wouldn’t suggest that.
[1816.84] We don’t have the budget already
[1818.48] and our company shares 
are crashing on a daily basis.
[1821.56] Then take a loan from the bank, 
put the factory as collateral.
[1823.80] There must be a way.
[1825.60] Putting the factory as collateral means that
[1827.48] if we don’t make payment on time,
[1829.16] then the factory will be in the bank’s name.
[1831.36] Too risky sir.
[1833.72] Noman, business always runs on risk
[1836.36] and this is not my first deal.
[1838.08] So do what I am telling you to.
[1839.80] But sir…I am done here.
[1911.56] Have some food, child.
[1917.28] Aunt, why did you bother coming?
[1920.68] I would have come myself.
[1924.08] If you sleep on an empty stomach,
[1927.72] then your uncle’s soul will suffer a lot.
[1932.88] He has left here really restless anyway.
[1935.76] Forgive me aunt.
[1940.92] I have been a burden on you people all my life,
[1947.20] and I became the reason for uncle’s death, 
when he left.
[1953.44] Don’t say that.
[1959.56] Right now I need you to forgive me.
[1964.80] I used to hate you all my life.
[1969.76] And hating you, I forgot that because of this,
[1975.60] I am making the path of my own child, 
worthless.
[1982.28] Sajjal is the punishment for my sins, 
child.
[1986.60] That was my fate.
[1989.28] No one has a fault.
[1992.56] No Irha,
[1995.16] it is not like that.
[1998.28] It is not like that at all.
[2001.72] If I had made my heart a little bigger, child,
[2006.44] and had I brought you up in place of 
my own child,
[2010.96] then Sajjal would never have 
dared to commit such a dirty crime.
[2019.60] But she killed us in our life time.
[2026.60] Why do we forget in our injustice that
[2030.92] there is a Judge sitting up in the sky
[2034.16] and when he punishes you,
[2037.36] there is no room for forgiveness.
[2041.60] I have wasted a lot of time.
[2045.52] But you for God’s sake,
[2048.24] for the sake of your uncle’s love,
[2053.84] forgive me.
[2056.28] Aunt. Forgive me. No.
[2061.76] Why are you embarrassing me 
by apologizing to me.
[2065.80] You are like my mother.
[2068.68] I am not upset with you at all.
I am not angry with you.
[2074.24] All this was written in my fate to happen.
[2079.56] You had a good fate, child.
[2083.72] From today, don’t forget one thing, 
you are not alone.
[2087.08] Your mother is with you.
 Your mother is with you.
[2093.40] You are not alone.
[2120.88] You killed my Hamid Ali.
[2123.40] Leave from here. Get lost.
[2125.44] Mama, let me see papa’s face…
You are dead for us.
[2129.20] And you died the time 
when you stole your sister’s right.
[2134.16] But you,
[2135.76] your infelicity didn’t end.
[2137.56] You didn’t stop.
[2139.16] You took Hamid Ali’s life. 
I say leave from here.
[2142.44] Leave from here, or I will take your life.
[2144.76] Leave. Get of here. Leave.
[2152.60] There is no place for you in this home,
[2153.96] get lost from here.
[2155.32] Our relation has ended.
[2157.84] And if you step in this home,
[2160.56] you will see my dead face.
[2163.28] Leave from here. Get out of here. Get lost.
[2166.80] Tell her to get lost from here.
