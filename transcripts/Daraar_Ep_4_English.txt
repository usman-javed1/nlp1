You killed my Hamid Ali. Leave from here. Get lost. Mama, let me see papa’s face… You are dead for us. your infelicity didn’t end. You didn’t stop. You took Hamid Ali’s life. I say leave from here. Leave from here, or I will take your life. Leave. Get of here. There is no place for you in this home, get lost from here. Our relation has ended. And if you step in this home, you will see my dead face. Leave from here. Get out of here. Get lost. Tell her to get lost from here. What happened? I was a little busy in office, that’s why… You were busy in the office? You are still worried about your office. Do you have any idea the torture I am going through? What happened, Sajjal? Are you okay? Did your mama and papa not forgive you? What happened? My papa passed away. Oh my God. Oh my God. All this…all this happened because of Irha. My mother pushed me out of the house. In front of Irha, in front of the neighbours. Irha believes in herself that 
she will come back to this home. I will surely take revenge from her. I will show her. She thinks she will come back to this home? What will you do? I will get her divorced. You will divorce her. You will divorce her! You will divorce her, I am saying you will divorce her, and you will divorce her soon. When will you divorce her? I hear you. I hear you. I have heard what you said. But you are not answering what I am saying. You will divorce her. You will divorce her. Okay. Sit. Irha will not live in this home now, okay? This is your home. Only you will live here. Divorce Irha. Irha, child, this is for you. Hey, it is really a pretty dress. Thank you so much. You liked it, right? Yes. It is pretty, right? Yes. It is pretty. Sajjal, child, this is for you. You got this for me? I don’t want to wear it. Is this even a colour to wear? You are my trust, my pride. Just always maintain it. Papa, I can never break your trust. I have an arrest warrant against you  for the allegation of stealing a diamond ring for a jewellery shop. Your daughter has stolen a ring worth two hundred thousand. I don’t want to go anywhere. Take her along. They are trapping me. What are you doing? Take her. Your daughter has given me
 a good name in the world. Shameless! Hey, Hamid Ali. Show her how she has made her father proud. Papa, this…I… That’s it. After today, if you step out of this home, then you will see the worst in me. Not even a leave can move in this home without my order. Me and a few friends stepped out for an adventure. And then…then everything went wrong. Look, I will count till three. If you don’t come out till I count three, then I will shoot. Sir there is a girl here too. So you have hid the girl here. Shaheer, you? Sajjal, what are you doing here? Shahrukh’s father has said that
 if you don’t get him released on bail, then… Then? Then what did he say? Then Shahrukh will leak my video. Shaheer is a decent boy from a good family, we cannot even like this about him. I left you here to take care of Irha, not to interfere in their lives. It would be better that you mind your own business. Both of us love each other
 and we will get married really soon. Did you not have shame? You are the daughter of a religious father. You should have had some shame and cared a little. You have forgotten the respect of
 relations and your shame completely. Nothing you people say will change my decision. And if you people don’t want to keep a relation with me, then don’t. even I am not interested in keeping
 a relation with you people. How are you talking to him? Have you forgotten? He is your father. Noshaba, leave her. She has become ill-mannered and shameless. Her conscience is dead. You people have heard Sajjal’s decision. You can go. We too don’t want to keep a relation
 with this cheap and shameless child. She is dead for us. So why are you standing here? Go from here. Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali. Papa. Papa. Don’t touch him. Get out of here. You are the murderer of my Hamid Ali.  You killed my Hamid Ali. Leave from here. Get lost from here. Mama, let me see papa’s face once. You are dead for us. Our relation is over. And if you step in this home, you will see my dead face. Leave from here, get out, get lost. How long ill you mourn? This had to happen one day. Till the time I don’t take revenge for my insult, I will not sit peacefully. What is the need to keep 
a relation with those people? It is good, enjoy your life happily. I will, but after I punish Irha. What will you get out of it? She has been punished enough already. Why do I feel that you don’t want to divorce her? You are imagining things. Then why didn’t you send the divorce papers till now? There is some property in her name. if I divorce her, then she will get it and I don’t want that. To make her happy, you put all the property in her name. and for me? Just consolation and hopes of conditions getting better. Why have you started to become
 too disappointed towards me? So, what else do I do? You have no idea about my worries. I left everything and came to you. I put everything on the line and you… Sajjal, I understand  but I am caught up in my own worries. I am really worried. How do I fulfil all your wishes in this condition? Shaheer, do you feel that I want all this? I didn’t mean that. I am saying that I am really worried, I am facing losses in the business. So all this worry is not because of me. Instead, I am getting insulted, I am being shamed because of you. Think about it. Sajjal. Sajjal, please, listen to me. If he doesn’t care about me, then I don’t care about him either. Maybe Shaheer is taking me for granted. I am sorry, I didn’t mean that. You got hurt for no reason. Does anyone get hurt on purpose? Your tone is so strange for me, like whatever problems are there in your life,
 they are because of me. When did I say that? Your style makes it all evident. Is there even a need to ask? If you are tired of me, then tell me, I will leave the home and go. Okay, forgive me, please. It will not happen in the future. If you want, I can hold my ears. You don’t get upset with me. you get upset with me, 
and life becomes difficult for me. Then why do you do  it? You know I get mad. I just want to see your madness for me, don’t waste it in your anger. Okay fine, then you divorce her as soon as possible
 and also take back all the property. All your wishes will be fulfilled. Okay? Why are you removing this, child? When the relation is broken, then why do I even keep the things connected to it. You will see Irha, one day Shaheer will really regret it. And Sajjal, she won’t even find a grave after she dies. Don’t curse her. What are you made of? She snatched everything from you, and you… you know well, she is a snake in the sleeve, still we had hopes from her. She can bite anyone when she gets the chance. You just pray for me that I get patience for all my life, Oh my child. You will find it. I got a call for a couple of interviews, you just pray for me. you will get that job. You will surely get the job. If you get busy, it will be easier to forget your sorrows. As soon as you go for the interview, I will pray for you immediately. The company will offer you a job immediately. Yes. You get ready I will make breakfast. What is this nonsense? How can our loan get rejected? Sir our company has already
 defaulted from the bank already. We cannot get further loan. Then think of another way. Standing quietly here won’t do anything. Sir, there is a solution. If you can do that. What? Tell me. Sir, you remember, you bought a property in the name of Miss Irha  and you bought a property for the orphan house. If we sell it, we can profit a lot. Why did I not think of that earlier? Sell that property. Sir, but I don’t think Miss Irha will agree. She and I have had a separation. I don’t think she will have
 a problem returning something I gave her. You get the papers ready, I will talk to the lawyer myself. Fine, I will talk to the dealer myself. Yes, Mr. Ayaz. Very good. You bring the papers by the evening, I will sign them. It would be better if you come to the office. Thank you. Miss Irha,  you used to work in an insurance company? Yes, sir. I don’t remember where I have seen you. I have not seen you there. Why does it matter, sir, where you saw me. You have to give me the job based on my capability, I remember. You are the wife of the industrialist Shaheer Ahmad. He owns a big company, why do you need a job? Sir, every person has some problems, some helplessness. Obviously, I cannot discuss those personal matters. But I really want this job. And I promise you that I will not disappoint you. I will work really hard. So, please. Miss Irha, we don’t have a job that is worthy of you and we cannot upset Mr. Shaheer Ahmad. Sorry. Sir, I need this job. I really need this job, please. And then nothing like this will happen. You believe me. Miss Irha, this is what you are saying, but the reality is completely different. I am sorry. Sajjal. Shaheer, you? I didn’t even find out. Actually, I wanted to give you a surprise, so I couldn’t stay in office, so I came. A surprise for me? What is this? You always have this complaint from me that 
I have never put anything in your name. This is an apartment and a few shares of my company. From today you are a shareholder in my company
 and you have your own apartment. What? Really? Honestly? Of course. But your company just faced a loss, then why all this for me. Because I cannot see you sad. No matter how much loss I have in business, you will always get profit. You are so good, Shaheer. I am so lucky that I found someone 
so good and loving like you. I am the lucky one who got your love, just always be mine. Is this even something to say? I will always stand by you. Yes, that’s it. That’s all I want. Don’t worry child, God must have something better in this. You don’t worry, don’t get disheartened. It is something worrisome aunt. Where ever I go for a job, they hear Shaheer’s name and says no. My capability, my experience means nothing. Okay listen, my heart says you will find a really good job one day. I should find it now. I don’t want to be a burden on you. and I have to take back Fatima from Shaheer. This will only be possible 
when I am able to stand on my feet. I have an idea, child. It is really difficult for you to
 live your life without your child. But child, on one hand, she is there with her father, she is living a life of peace and comfort. And the luxuries Shaheer can give her, you cannot even give them even if you want. But what do I do with this heart, that is restless for it’s child, aunt. I am unable to sleep all night. Fatima’s voice is echoes in my ears, she is calling out to me. I don’t know what condition she must be in. I don’t know how she will be living without me. Just have faith in God. I am completely sure that  one day God will bless you for your patience  and your motherhood will find peace. Don’t worry child, God will make it all fine. Good morning. Thank you. I am sorry Miss Irha, we have selected our candidate. Apologies for making you come over. I don’t know what helplessness Mrs. Shaheer 
has that she is searching for such a job. What? What are you doing? Your daughter is really cute, Just like my Fatima. Now Fatima too must be six months old, she must get up and sit. And after two months, she will also start running. I am just really unlucky
 that I cannot spend time with her. But where is your daughter? She is in a really good place. Where ever she is, she must be really happy. and a plate of french fries. Okay. Buddy, I need to take this call, I will be back. Now are leaving like this 
during family time for a call. Some family time… Just two minutes. Oh God. Can you not see? Leave it. Stop it. Be quiet. Why don’t you listen to me? What is the need to scold such a small child? Don’t you see how much she is screaming? Everyone must be looking, what do I do? Look at her. You think it makes a difference to me
 what others think about us? All I am asking is that you fix 
your behaviour towards the child. My behaviour should be good? Should we not teach her something? She is a small child. What do you expect from her? Did you see? Did you see?
