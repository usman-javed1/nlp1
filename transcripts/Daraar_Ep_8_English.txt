Did you see your position in this home? In Shaheer’s heart? Now, no need to murmur. If you stay in a corner of this home,
 then you will save yourself from being kicked around by the world or else even you 
wont be able to live a life without luxuries now. What did I not give you? Money. Fame. Respect. This name. Where ever you go,
 thousands of people go around you, because you are my wife. I took you from the ground and 
made you sit in the sky and this is how you repay me? It was my fault. It was completely my fault that
 I took dirt from the road and put it on my head. The way you are being so stubborn in front of me, it is only because of me. Or else, what were you? An ordinary insurance company’s employees, 
who used to walk around for a few thousands. I changed your worth. Did you see your position in this home? In Shaheer’s heart? Now, no need to murmur. If you stay in a corner of this home, 
then you will save yourself from being kicked around by the world or else even you 
wont be able to live a life without luxuries now. Don’t forget one thing. This home is not yours, it is mine. Everything here is mine. Whatever happens here will be by my will. Sajjal is living here by my will and 
she will not go anywhere. So she is robbing my right 
with your own will? Did your heart not shudder stabbing me in the back? You are my sister, right? Is this how sisters are? Why don’t you ask this question to 
your husband who went mad in my love? If your love had power, then you should have stopped him.
 Why are you blaming me? when ruining my home? Did you not feel ashamed for a moment, Did you not even realize it a little? I only had this home with me, 
that you snatched from me. You are overreacting for no reason. What is the big deal in this? Let whatever is happening, happen.
 No one will find out anything. No, Shaheer Ahmad, no. You have really wronged me. So decide today. Fix your mistakes, and confess your sins. And decide who will live in this home. A husband’s job is not to give his wife money,
 fame, wealth, jewellery, money, Shaheer. A husband’s duty is not to pick her 
from the ground and make her sit on the sky. The relation of a husband and wife is that of trust, love, faith and belief. But that is no longer in you. You have changed, right? So you have forgotten all relations. Thank you so much for reminding me of my worth. But the painful thing is that all this is true, 
Shaheer. Elders have said correctly, the love of man is like a fountain in the mountain, it doesn’t go on, it stops. But a woman, her love is like a stream, it keeps on flowing, it keeps on flowing. It never ends. This is my love, towards you and 
my daughter that is stopping me or else I would never have tolerate all this. I can do justice with both of you. Sit comfortably. Die of shame, Shaheer. I have made my decision. Now you need to decide. Thank you, Shaheer. Today you made me believe 
how important I am for you. Why? Did you not believe me earlier? Love is such a thing, it needs reassurance day and night. Okay leave all this. Let’s go for lunch today. Just you and me. Your mood will get fine, 
and we will talk about the future as well. Yes, let’s go. You can say this with a smile on your face as well. Why are you spoiling your mood? Your companionship is so beautiful that 
I can never be sad. Just never leave me and go. I have burned all the ships and come. I will live with you all my life. These things you say win my heart. I want to put everything 
I have on the line for you. I am the one you were searching for, for ages. Leave her. We will make our own world. In which only you and me will be there, and our love. What you want will happen. Then hold your heart today. We have enjoyed so much today. Huh? It felt like the biggest burden 
of the world has been removed. I didn’t want to come back. I will have to see her crying face again. Yes, she was really looking like a heroine from the 70s. My home, my husband. It is all your fault. She is not worthy of you at all. At times a person is unable to think. But anyway, you are in my life now. I have no sorrow. Now fix your mistakes as soon as possible, and send her away from this home. Before she says all sort of things to mama and papa. What are you afraid of now? She has found out everything. You have no idea, she is really dear to papa. And if papa finds out, 
then he will take severe decisions. Now I have come in your life, so you don’t need to be afraid of anyone. When you have burned all the ships, then believe me. I will never let you down. I had burned them, 
the moment is stepped in your life. I was only afraid that the time and situation might change you. But now I don’t even fear that. Then enjoy your life to the fullest, because life is really beautiful. And you are more beautiful than life. That’s Fatima crying. Please go and check what happened to her? What is wrong with you Shaheer? She is a child, 
if she doesn’t cry, then what will she do? She must be hungry, 
or maybe Irha is changing her. Why are you spoiling your mood? Go check on her once, please. 
She has never cried like this before. I don’t want to see her face at all. If you want, can I get coffee made for you? Yes, please get it made. What happened to her? 
Why is she crying so much? I don’t know sir, I have tried my best, 
but she is not getting quiet. Where is Irha? She didn’t inform me before leaving. Did she take her things along? No, she left empty handed from here. Come on, give her to me. Give her to me.
You have made her cry so much. Go get her milk. Yes, sir. That’s it. That’s it. Papa is here. That’s it. That’s it. Well done. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Good girl. Okay? Yes. Yes. Now you are not crying, daddy is here. It is okay, everything will be fine. Papa is here, everything will be fine. Okay? Why are you holding her? Where is Irha? She is not at home. Why? Has she left the home and gone? I don’t know, but I am angry how 
she left the child in this condition and went. She is torturing you on purpose. This is just a move of hers. These cheap moves of her wont affect me. I can take care of my daughter myself. Okay, give Fatima to me, and check where she went. No, she is sleeping. If I give her to you, 
she will get disturbed. Leave it. The SP is calling? Is everything fine? You give Fatima to me, and attend the phone. Here. Careful, please. Hello. Yes, greetings Mr. SP. When I left for the police station, 
I found out that they shifted you from there. Are you fine, Sabira? Sister Irha, I have not done anything. For the sake of God, take me out of here. A false allegation has been put on me. 
I have small children. I know you have been blamed. I have come to you for this truth. But now you will have to tell me the entire truth. Sister Irha, the truth is really bitter, you will not be able to tolerate it. If I tolerated becoming an orphan in childhood, then I will also be able to tolerate the truth of 
my husband’s unfaithfulness, Sabira. You tell me what happened? Madam Sajjal used to go around Mr. Shaheer all the time, 
since she had come here. One night when madam Sajjal was leaving 
Mr. Shaheer’s room, madam saw her. She was really hurt. 
She couldn’t tolerate all this. Did you share any details with her? Okay. She didn’t file an FIR, right? Alright. Fine. Thanks for informing me. Do keep me in the loop. Bye. What happened? What was the SP saying? Irha went to the police station. What? Police station? Why did she go to the police station? I don’t know. You should find out, 
what if she is filing a case against you. She doesn’t have the courage to
 take a step against me. The real reason is something else. When she comes back we will find out. You should still find out. What if, she takes such a step that 
can lead to your defamation? That is not possible with me alive. I have to make a couple of important calls, you please stay with Fatima. 
Don’t leave her alone. Yes, don’t worry. Where are you coming from so late at night? Why do you care? I care, because legally and
 religiously you are still my wife. I have the right to question you, 
and ask you for answers. You remember your rights, but you have forgotten all your responsibilities. I don’t want to get into a useless discussion again. Why did you go to the police station? This means I have been spied on. I have my eye on everything. Why did you go to meet Sabira? To know the truth. The cheap allegations that you
 two have put together on that poor, innocent woman. You got her punished. Did you not feel ashamed even once? Where is your conscience dead, Shaheer? Where have you put your conscience to sleep? Grandma died 
because of your shamelessness and disregard. The same grandmother 
who used to have faith in you. But you didn’t have shame. You are crossing your limit. You have crossed your limit. Someone who doesn’t remember anything. Not the family name, nor rules, nor respect for relations. Stop this nonsense or else… Or else what? What will you do? You will divorce me? Or will you leave me? 
Or will you drag me out of the house? That wont be necessary, because before that 
I am leaving you and going myself. Because not I am disgusted by you. I feel suffocated in this home of yours. Yes, but before I leave, 
I surely want to ask you a question. She was in the habit to put her respect 
and name on the line from the start. But when did you fall so low? What did you see in her? Peace. Happiness. Feelings. Something I don’t get from you. Oh, I will disappointed that 
I tortured you for so long. But now you two can choose each other. Because naturally such girls don’t settle to one man. And such men don’t live with one woman either. Listen to me. Stop. Why are you creating a scene? In the eyes of the world you are still my wife. If you want, you can stay. No, Shaheer Ahmed. A woman will not be helpless every time. Leave her. She will not go anywhere from here. Fatima is my daughter, Shaheer. You cannot do this injustice with a mother. 
She will live with me. She has a home, a respectable father. She is not an orphan and hopeless like you. Give her to me. But I too have no other reason to live. She is my last hope. I will never give her to you. I told you, Fatima won’t go! If you want to leave from here, then leave. She won’t go from here. After all, 
you are in the habit of going around aimlessly. Give her to me. I don’t have a sister, a brother, or parents. She is my entire world. You cannot snatch her from me. 
You cannot be this cruel that you are even forgiven, Shaheer. Give her to me. Don’t do this. 
Give her to me. Shaheer, give me my daughter. Shaheer. Shaheer, Fat… Shaheer. Shaheer. Shaheer. Here you go, from today you are her mother. When she grows up, 
tell her that her mother died at birth. No. Give me my daughter, don’t be so cruel that 
God closes the doors of forgiveness on you. What will happen with me, will happen. I too will see what can you achieve after the label of 
Shaheer Ahmed is removed from you. Shaheer, please… You still have time. If you love your child so much,
 then live in this home quietly, respectfully. This cannot happen. Then Fatima too won’t go anywhere. If you step out of this home, then remember, 
coming back won’t be possible. What sort of a mother are you, Irha? How can you leave a few day old child, 
and go like this? Are you not ashamed? What will happen with me, will happen. I too will see what can you achieve after 
the label of Shaheer Ahmed is removed from you. Shaheer, please… You still have time. If you love your child so much, 
then live in this home quietly, respectfully. This cannot happen. Then Fatima too won’t go anywhere.
