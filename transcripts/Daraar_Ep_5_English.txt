How are you? One meeting is necessary for me to live, love I will meet you my love, but right now there are some problems. Okay, I thought you have given your heart to someone else, that is why you don’t miss me. You know what I like that most about you? You don’t pretend. You accept whatever is there. Those who are afraid of the world pretend. I have no such helplessness. Did you not miss me, or is she more beautiful? Who, she? The same, for whom you have dragged your wife out of the home. Your wife’s cousin. How do you know? You live in my heart, Shaheer, it is impossible I don’t have news of you. For the first time I am jealous of someone, 
Shaheer. It has been six months, and you have not come to meet me. She is the reason for this. Where are you nowadays? I am around you. I will come across her one day, and when I meet her, I will take her life. I am unable to accept this unfaithfulness. Where is your conscience dead, 
Shaheer? Where did you put your conscience to sleep? Grandma got killed 
because of your shamelessness and cold bloodedness. That grandma who had faith in you, but you didn’t have shame. you are crossing your limits. You have crossed your limits. You don’t remember anything. Not the family name, not rules, neither respect for relations. Shut your nonsense, or else… 
Or else what? What will you do? Divorce me? Or leave me? Or drag me out of your home? There will be no need for that, because before that 
I am leaving you myself and going. Hello. Fine, make them sit in the drawing room,
 I am coming. Thank you, Shaheer. For what? For the new staff. Oh. You like it? Yes, everything is fine. But the cook is okay, I will try him for two three days, 
if I don’t like the taste, I will get him changed. The home is yours, so is the staff, change whoever you want. Hah. Today, I don’t hear Fatima cry. 
What is the deal? I think you have learned to take care of her. I gave her to the maid. She cries so much. When she starts crying, she doesn’t stop. I don’t know who she takes up after. Come with me, 
I have to talk to you about something important. What is it that you cannot talk about in the room? I will tell you. Come. Your parents are here. You can do it. They think I have kept you here forcefully. In fact, I have kept you hostage. Today, tell them what the truth is yourself. Shaheer Ahmed, we have come to take Sajjal. And we will not go without taking her. and if she doesn’t want to leave herself, then? Shaheer is right. I don’t want to leave him and go anywhere. But, with what relation will you live with him here? The two of us love each other, and we will get married really soon too. Did you not have shame? You are the daughter of a religious father. Hey, you should have had a little shame 
or had some respect. Don’t forget that
 you are standing in my home right now. What will you do? What can you do? She is our daughter. We will talk to her like we want, who are you to interfere? 
I am living here by my will. No one can force me to leave from here. Leave from here. You have forgotten the respect of relation, your shame, everything. No matter what you say, 
it won’t change my decision. And if you people don’t want 
to keep a relation with me, then don’t. Even I am not interested in keep 
any relation with you people. What tone are you talking to him with? Have you forgotten? He is your father. You will go around aimlessly. You will be insulted in front of the whole world. You will not be able to face anyone. And why are you on a mission to 
get us insulted in our old age. Noshaba, let her be. She has become ill-mannered and shameless.
 Her conscience is dead. Is this what I taught her? That she steals in her own home. You people have heard Sajjal’s decision. You people can leave. We too don’t want to keep a relation with this cheap and shameless child. She is dead for us. Then why are you people standing here? Go from here. Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali. Papa. Papa. Mama. Papa. Leave from here. Get lost from here. And don’t you dare go near my husband. Go from here. And you two leave from here, 
get lost from here. Mama… Your mother is dead. Go from here. Leave. I will go meet, papa…Go away from here. What are you doing? Sajjal, come. Come with me. 
Leave from here. Go. Uncle. Forgive…forgive…forgive…forgive me. What is your fault in this, uncle? This was my fate. Don’t blame yourself. 
Nothing will happen to you, you will be absolutely fine. Uncle? Aunt, why is uncle not saying anything? Hamid Ali. Uncle….Hamid Ali. Doctor. Look here. 
Talk to me Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali. Doctor, see what happened to my husband. Uncle is not saying anything. See, what happened to him. Hamid Ali. Uncle. Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali. Hamid Ali. What happened? I am sorry, he is no longer in this world. Uncle. You are the daughter of a religious father. Hey, you should have had a little shame
 or had some respect. You will go around aimlessly. You will be insulted in front of the whole world. You will not be able to face anyone. And why are you 
on a mission to get us insulted in our old age. You people have heard Sajjal’s decision. You people can leave. We too don’t want to keep a relation 
with this cheap and shameless child. She is dead for us. Then why are you people standing here? Go from here. What are you doing? I am serving you, and serving you is my responsibility, 
don’t stop me from it. Get up. Your place is in my heart, not in my feet. Don’t do this again. Okay? Irha also used to do it, 
you never stopped her. She was my wife, you are my lover. A wife can sit in the feet, 
but not the lover. I want your companionship, You are sitting here. I was waiting for you in the room. Whatever happened today,
 it shouldn’t have happened. You are regretting so soon. I shouldn’t have left the hospital like this. I don’t know what condition papa would be in. Those people don’t want to see your face, and you want to stay in the hospital. They are my parents, they have a right to be upset with me, and it is my obligation to convince them. I don’t want that 
our new life should start by upsetting them. Okay, then who has stopped you? Go ahead. Will you come along with me to convince them? You go. Shaheer, if the two of us go together 
it would be easy to convince papa. Your mother really insulted me. But Shaheer…No buts. 
If you want to go, then go. I will not go there on any condition. That’s it. Please. For my sake. I ruined my home for your sake, you still doubt my love. I wouldn’t even doubt you even if I was dead. I was just saying it. Don’t say anything. I am going to sleep, Your mother is dead. You have killed my husband. Go from here. Leave. I will go meet, papa… Go away from here. Yes, Shaheer, I just came home, to meet papa. My heart was really worried. Why do you worry? You are his child, and then you didn’t do anything wrong. You also have a right to live your life by your liking. Maybe you are forgetting that Irha takes papa’s side, and you know, only God knows 
how much she would have instigated him by now. Look, she will do anything in her jealousy, because you are trying to take her place. But you have to be strong, for the sake of our love. Okay? Where is Fatima? No, Fatima is with the maid. She will take care of her. You know she cannot stay with strangers. You should have kept her with you. Shaheer, she was sleeping. After all, I have not come for long, 
I will come back home in a little while. Okay. Anyway, be brave. Even if they don’t agree, 
still my love wont be any less for you. You are my love. The world should bend for you, not you. I love you Shaheer. I love you too. Bye. Rayyan, is everything fine, son? Sister Sajjal, don’t you know? What don’t I know? Your father passed away. What? Papa. Papa. Papa. Papa. Don’t touch him. Get out of here. You are the murderer of my Hamid Ali. Leave from here. Get lost. Mama, let me see papa’s face…
You are dead for us. And you died 
the time when you stole your sister’s right. But you, your infelicity didn’t end. You didn’t stop. You took Hamid Ali’s life. 
I say leave from here. Leave from here, or I will take your life. Leave. Get of here. Leave. Mama, Mama, I beg of you. Please just once, let me see my father's face. 
then I'll leave from here Before, I’ll kill you with my own hands,
 get out of here. Aunt, this is not the time to do all this. Leave her. Let her be. You leave. What does she think? She will do everything and 
no one will question her. I said leave from here. Why didn’t you die? Leave from here, 
leave. Get lost. What are you doing? 
What are you saying? You will regret it. I am your own child, mama. 
And go where you had stained your face. There is no place for you in this home, 
get lost from here. Our relation has ended. And if you step in this home, you will see my dead face. Leave from here. Get out of here. Get lost. Tell her to get lost from here. Sit down. Sit down. Give me water. Drink some water. That’s it, aunt. I am really worried for Irha. Hey, as per religion and law, 
both of them can stay married. With the condition that a woman tolerates it. That too like her. If Irha’s husband had to do this, then he would have just married Sajjal. What was the need to ruin Irha’s life? I feel sorry for Irha. Poor thing. I think the husband snatched her daughter too, I don’t see her anywhere. Yes, I don’t see her anywhere. You people saw how 
I dragged Sajjal out of this home. Hey, she is dead for us, 
we have no relation with her. I have just one daughter. 
Just one daughter, Irha. I beg you people, for God’s sake, if you want to be part of our sorrow,
 then for God’s sake, let my Hamid Ali leave in peace. That’s it, aunt. There must be some room. 
Why did you not try to convince them? I have tried my best sir, but I am sorry to say that 
maybe this is not a good time for us. That is why every deal 
we make is getting cancelled after being finalized. And we have a loss of billions. But how is it possible? You know what 
they say about me in the business community? I have got the Midas touch. Whatever I touch turns to gold. It used to turn to gold, but now that same gold is turning to sand. Sir, we had still not settled from the
 deal in Germany that we have faced another big loss. If this continues to be the condition,
 then the company can go bankrupt soon. Nothing like that will happen. Ups and downs come in business. You make a contract with Lashari industries, I am sure 
we will be able to get our shares back within a month. I wouldn’t suggest that. We don’t have the budget already and our company shares 
are crashing on a daily basis. Then take a loan from the bank, 
put the factory as collateral. There must be a way. Putting the factory as collateral means that if we don’t make payment on time, then the factory will be in the bank’s name. Too risky sir. Noman, business always runs on risk and this is not my first deal. So do what I am telling you to. But sir…I am done here. Have some food, child. Aunt, why did you bother coming? I would have come myself. If you sleep on an empty stomach, then your uncle’s soul will suffer a lot. He has left here really restless anyway. Forgive me aunt. I have been a burden on you people all my life, and I became the reason for uncle’s death, 
when he left. Don’t say that. Right now I need you to forgive me. I used to hate you all my life. And hating you, I forgot that because of this, I am making the path of my own child, 
worthless. Sajjal is the punishment for my sins, 
child. That was my fate. No one has a fault. No Irha, it is not like that. It is not like that at all. If I had made my heart a little bigger, child, and had I brought you up in place of 
my own child, then Sajjal would never have 
dared to commit such a dirty crime. But she killed us in our life time. Why do we forget in our injustice that there is a Judge sitting up in the sky and when he punishes you, there is no room for forgiveness. I have wasted a lot of time. But you for God’s sake, for the sake of your uncle’s love, forgive me. Aunt. Forgive me. No. Why are you embarrassing me 
by apologizing to me. You are like my mother. I am not upset with you at all.
I am not angry with you. All this was written in my fate to happen. You had a good fate, child. From today, don’t forget one thing, 
you are not alone. Your mother is with you.
 Your mother is with you. You are not alone. You killed my Hamid Ali. Leave from here. Get lost. Mama, let me see papa’s face…
You are dead for us. And you died the time 
when you stole your sister’s right. But you, your infelicity didn’t end. You didn’t stop. You took Hamid Ali’s life. 
I say leave from here. Leave from here, or I will take your life. Leave. Get of here. Leave. There is no place for you in this home, get lost from here. Our relation has ended. And if you step in this home, you will see my dead face. Leave from here. Get out of here. Get lost. Tell her to get lost from here.
